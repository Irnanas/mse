<h2 id="our-main-plans">Our Main Plans</h2>
<div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title1"  /><label for="title1">Food Security</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p><strong>SINGAPORE'S FOOD SUPPLY</strong><br>  Singapore imports more than 90 percent of our food. This makes us vulnerable to external supply disruptions which are compounded by depleting natural resources, climate change and geopolitical and disease situations.</p>
		<p><strong>ENSURING AND SECURING SINGAPORE'S FOOD SUPPLY</strong><br>  Singapore Food Agency (SFA) safeguards Singapore’s food supply through three food security strategies, known as the three “food baskets”:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><p>Diversifying food sources – Singapore imports from over 170 countries and regions to mitigate the impact of a disruption on our food supply. SFA accredits new food import source for higher risk food items (e.g. meat) to facilitate the industry’s source diversification while ensuring that our food imports are safe.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p>Growing locally – Singapore produces 26% of our eggs, 14% of leafy vegetables and 10% of fish locally. Local production buffers the impact of a disruption from an overseas source. SFA enables the growth of the local agri-food industry through funding, availing new land and spaces for food production, industry development, facilitating regulatory reviews.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p>Growing overseas – SFA supports Singapore companies to export urban food solutions to other countries so that they can break into new markets and expand their scale of production. To date, local farms have ventured into Australia, Brunei, Hong Kong, Thailand and China.</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title2"  /><label for="title2">"30 By 30" Local Production Goal</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>SFA aims to increase local production to achieve the “30 by 30” goal, which is to produce 30% of Singapore’s nutritional needs locally by 2030, up from less than 10% today. This calls for a game-change of the local agri-food sector into one that is highly productive, innovative and sustainable and SFA is embarking on several key initiatives.</p>
		<p>For instance, SFA will be embarking on a holistic master planning exercise for the farmlands in Lim Chu Kang to attract and facilitate the growth of high-tech, highly productive, resource-efficient farms. The exercise will explore the design for shared facilities for district cooling systems, water intake and waste management/ valorisation to achieve economies of scale and sustainability.</p>
		<p>We are also creating an ecosystem to ensure sufficient players across the value chain enter and stay within the market. Next year, we will be launching the Agri-Food Innovation Park (AFIP), a pilot cluster to catalyse innovation by anchoring global agri-food players in Singapore and co-locating high-tech urban farming with agri-food R&D activities.  SFA is also looking to unlock the potential of farming at sea to boost local production of fish, enhancing our food security.</p>
		<p>To support the agri-food industry expand production capabilities through technology adoption, SFA has made available funding schemes such as the $63mil Agriculture Productivity Fund, and awarded over $39mil under the “30 by 30 Express” grant call to support innovative proposals that can scale up local production.</p>
		<p>At the same time, SFA is also strengthening our R&D capabilities to undertake agri-food research. We have committed $144million under the RIE2020 Plan to carry out research in sustainable urban food production, future foods and food safety. The outcomes of these R&D projects will be translated into feasible and scalable initiatives that our local industry can adopt.</p>
		<p>As the agri-food industry grows, new higher value-add jobs will be created. We are building a local talent pipeline to equip Singaporeans with the skillsets to take up these job opportunities and support the growth of the sector. SFA is working with various Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) and local farms on programmes such as diploma courses and structured internship programmes to equip students and adult job seekers with skillsets that will lead to specialised careers in the sector.</p>
		<p>Lastly, as we ramp up local production, we will need the support of all Singaporeans to eat local. By choosing locally produced food, we can all play a part in contributing to food security.</p>

<h2>Food Safety</h2>
<div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title3"  /><label for="title3">Making Sure Food Is Safe For Everyone</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>There are more than 48,000 food retail establishments, serving a huge variety of food choices in Singapore.</p>
		<p>SFA regulates the food retail industry in Singapore to ensure that food sold at retail outlets and food stalls is prepared hygienically and safe for consumption.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title4"  /><label for="title4">The Challenge: Maintaining High Standards</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Food hygiene standards were put in place since 1960s when an island-wide registration of street hawkers was carried out. Since then, food sellers had to comply with stringent food hygiene requirements.</p>
		<p>Before that, some 24,000 hawkers had been selling food on the streets. This created problems, including poor hygiene. Without proper equipment and water supply, street hawkers did not keep their utensils clean and protect their food from contamination. Food and liquid wastes also polluted streets, posing threats to public health.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title5"  /><label for="title5">Our Efforts: Monitoring And Educating</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p><em>Food Hygiene Efforts</em></p>
		<p>Grading Foodstalls and Shops:<br>  Since 1997, all eating establishments and food stalls are graded annually, based on criteria like housekeeping, cleanliness, pest infestation, food hygiene and personal hygiene of food handlers.</p>
		<p>Penalising Food Hygiene Lapses:<br>  Demerit points are given for each public health offence that is convicted in court or compounded. If a licensee accumulates 12 demerit points or more within 12 months, his licence will either be suspended for 2 weeks or 4 weeks, or be revoked, depending on past suspension records.</p>
		<p>SG Clean for Food Retail Establishments<br>  The “SG Clean’ quality mark is progressively rolled out to various sectors, starting from hawker centers, to rally sectors to commit to upholding food sanitation and hygiene practices such as cleaning methodology, toilet cleanliness and general public hygiene.</p>
		<p><em>Educating Food Handlers, Enhancing Food Hygiene Officer Framework</em></p>
		<p>All food handlers are required by law to attend and pass a Food Hygiene Course before they are allowed to work. They must also attend and pass a Refresher Food Hygiene Course every 3 years.</p>
		<p>All licensed establishments will also be required to appoint a Food Hygiene Officer (FHO) to reinforce hygiene and sanitation standards. FHOs are allowed to progress to Advanced FHOs through training to develop a higher competency.</p>
