<h1><b>Our Energy Policy in a Nutshell</b></h1>

<p><strong>REDUCING EMISSIONS</strong><br>  A vibrant Singapore relies on readily available energy. However, we are looking for ways to produce and consume energy sustainably while reducing carbon emissions.</p>

<h2 id="our-key-targets">Our Key Targets</h2>
<p>We aim to peak emissions at 65 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub> around 2030 and halve our emissions from its peak to 33MtCO<sub>2</sub>e by 2050, with a view to achieving net zero emissions as soon as viable in the second half of the century.</p>
<p>To that end, we also aim to reduce our energy intensity (energy consumed per dollar GDP) by 35% in 2030 from 2005 levels.</p>

<h2 id="our-main-plans">Our Main Plans</h2>
<div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title1"  /><label for="title1">Encouraging Energy Conservation And Efficiency</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Energy consumption is one of the main sources of carbon emissions in Singapore. Our industrial and commercial activities, transport systems and household appliances all run on electricity and fossil fuel. We encourage energy efficiency among households, industry, and the public sector to reduce carbon emissions through regulations, capability building, and incentives.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title2"  /><label for="title2">Searching For Clean Sources Of Energy</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>In addition to being more energy-efficient, we need to find cleaner sources of energy, despite being alternative energy disadvantaged. Singapore will push the boundaries in solar deployment, while exploring the possibility of importing renewable energy and using low-carbon alternatives.</p>

<h2>Improving Energy Efficiency</h2>
<div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title3"  /><label for="title3">The Issue</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Energy is essential for our day-to-day living and powers our industries, commercial and transport activities. However, as our nation develops and population grows, our energy consumption has also gone up. We need to ensure that this precious resource is used wisely, for the sake of energy security, as well as reducing our carbon emissions.</p>
		<p>Energy conservation does not mean changing lifestyles drastically. It encourages the using of energy in a smarter way to achieve the same results with less energy. Not only does it reduce carbon emissions and pollutants, it enables us to achieve savings in our utility bills.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title4"  /><label for="title4">Our Efforts</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p><strong>Households</strong><br>  We have  implemented measures to help households improve energy efficiency by setting Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) for major energy consuming household appliances, and subject them to a Mandatory Energy Labelling Scheme (MELS) to help households make informed purchasing decisions. In 2020, we launched the  Climate-Friendly Household Programme to assist 1-room to 3-room HDB households to switch to more resource-efficient appliances.</p>
		<p><strong>Industries</strong><br>  Businesses, meanwhile, can tap on various initiatives run by the Energy Efficiency Programme Office. These include participation in the Energy Efficiency National Partnership (EENP). The EENP allows companies to gain access to energy efficiency best practices, as well as the Energy Efficiency Fund, which supports up to 50% of qualifying costs of their energy efficiency initiatives.</p>
		<p><em>Energy Conservation Act</em></p>
		<p>There are further measures in place for large energy users in particular sectors. The Energy Conservation Act requires large energy users in the industry and transport sectors to appoint energy managers, report energy use, and put in place good energy management practices. The Act also sets out minimum energy performance standards for industrial equipment. We also implemented an enhanced set of Industry Energy Efficiency schemes to give a stronger push for industrial facilities, including those in the Energy and Chemical (E&C) sector, to be more energy-efficient.</p>
		<p><strong>Transport</strong><br>  We will also green our major international transport facilities. Tuas Port, when completed by the 2040s, will consolidate Singapore’s container operations in a single automated terminal. This, and the reduction in inter-haulage operations by road and sea, will provide greater efficiency and lower emissions. Changi Airport’s new Terminal 5 will also be designed and built according to stringent energy efficiency standards, and is anticipated to achieve Green Mark Platinum standards.</p>
		<p><strong>Buildings</strong><br>  As of March 2020, we have greened more than 40 per cent of our buildings (by gross floor area) and target to green 80 per cent by 2030. We have developed the Super Low Energy (SLE) Building Programme, to encourage the industry to achieve best-in-class building energy performance in a cost-effective manner. To support the push towards more energy-efficient buildings, we plan to raise the minimum energy performance standards for all new and existing buildings undergoing major retrofitting works.</p>
		<p><strong>Public Sector</strong><br>  The public sector is taking the lead in improving energy efficiency. We have adopted measures like contracting companies to identify energy savings measures when undertaking building retrofit projects, increasing air conditioner temperatures, and setting overall targets for energy efficiency.</p>

<h2>Clean Energy</h2>
<div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title5"  /><label for="title5">The Issue: Using Clean Energy Helps Combat Climate Change</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>The use of conventional energy sources such as fossil fuels to power Singapore results in the emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, contributing to climate change. Clean energy sources can help us meet our energy needs while minimising the environmental impact.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title6"  /><label for="title6">The Challenge</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>However, our small land area, geographical location and other physical attributes make it hard for us to adopt other kinds of energy sources. Singapore is an "alternative energy-disadvantaged" country, as recognised under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). We lack the natural characteristics necessary to make use of non-fossil alternatives such as hydroelectricity, wind energy and geothermal energy. Solar power is one possible renewable energy source we can adopt, but its viability is affected by limited land and rooftop space, and amount of cloud cover and humidity, among other factors.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title7"  /><label for="title7">Our Efforts</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Singapore will rely on four ways to obtain cleaner energy:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><p>We are using more natural gas – the cleanest of fossil fuels – to cut down our emissions.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p>We have expanded the use of solar energy in Singapore. We achieved our target of generating 350 megawatt-peak of electricity in 2020, and aim to deploy at least 2 gigawatt-peak by 2030 (enough to power around 10 per cent of the peak daily electricity demand today). We will achieve this by making use of technologies such as floating solar photovoltaic systems on our reservoirs and offshore waters, to overcome our land constraints. We also aim to deploy 200 megawatts of energy storage beyond 2025.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p>We aim to set up a regional power grid, which enables us to import electricity generated from neighbouring countries’ renewable energy sources. We will begin with a pilot measure: importing 100 megawatts from Malaysia for two years. We are also signing an agreement with Laos, Thailand and Malaysia to explore the possibility of multilateral trade in power.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p>We are exploring the use of low-carbon fuels like hydrogen, as well as measures like carbon capture utilisation and storage. We have set aside $49 million for research into such technologies.</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Having cleaner energy sources will also allow us to reduce carbon emissions in the transport sector. We aim to phase out internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and have all vehicles run on cleaner energy by 2040.  To encourage take-up of cleaner vehicles, new electric vehicle (EV) purchases will receive rebates for a three-year period from January 2021. We will also expand the public EV charging infrastructure significantly.</p>
