## Our Clean Air Policy in a Nutshell

1.  **GOOD AIR QUALITY PROTECTS PUBLIC HEALTH**  
    Clean air protects our health and is an important component of quality of life.
    
2.  **POWERING OUR NEEDS IN A GREENER WAY**  
    Industries, power stations, and motor vehicles are the main sources of air pollution. However, these are essential functions we cannot forego. To ensure good air quality, we set emission standards and encourage the adoption of progressively cleaner fuels in the industrial and transportation sectors.

## Our Key Targets

1.  To maintain the Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) for ambient air within the ‘good’ range for 85% of the year, and within the ‘moderate’ range for remaining 15%.
    
2.  Lower the annual ambient level of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) to 12 µg/m3  by 2020 and maintain it at this level till 2030.
    
3.  Keep annual ambient level of sulphur dioxide under 15µg/m3  till 2030.
    
4.  We are currently exploring more stringent air quality targets that are benchmarked to World Health Organisation’s Air Quality Guidelines.

## Our Main Plans

1.  **URBAN PLANNING TO KEEP POLLUTION AWAY**  
    Environmental problems can be avoided through proper land use planning. In Singapore, an integrated approach is adopted to ensure that environmental considerations are factored in our land-use planning, development control and building control stages in order to minimise pollution impacts and mitigate nuisance impacts on surrounding land uses. Industries are sited in designated industrial estates with adequate buffer from residential estates.  
    
    Before industries are allowed to operate in Singapore, they are screened to ensure they do not pose un-manageable pollution problems and health and safety hazards. In addition, they have to incorporate pollution control measures to comply with NEA’s air emissions standards and regulations.

    <br>
2.  **REDUCE EMISSIONS FROM VEHICLES**  
    All new vehicles in Singapore have to meet minimum emission standards.
    
    Emission standards have been progressively tightened over the years, taking into consideration the cost and environmental benefits. The next standard for all new diesel vehicles is the Euro V emission standard, to be mandated from 1 Jan 2014. Diesel vehicles registered on or after 1 October 2006 are required to meet at least Euro IV standard while all new petrol vehicles have to comply with Euro II standard since 1 January 2001. Euro V emission standard will be mandated for all new diesel vehicles from 1 Jan 2014.
   
    Existing vehicles on the road are required to undergo regular inspections to ensure that they do not emit excessive smoke.

## About Air Quality


**Air Quality is Essential to Health**

Ensuring good air quality safeguards public health and is an important component of our quality of life.

As a city develops, air pollutants are inevitably produced. Without control measures, increased urbanisation and industrialisation threaten to degrade our air quality. While our air quality is relatively good as compared to major cities, our levels of sulphur dioxide and fine particulate matter, such as PM2.5, remain a concern.

PM2.5 refers to fine air particles that measure less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter. These air particles are often found in dirt, dust and soot, and are dangerous to health because they can lodge deep in our lungs.

**The Challenge: Modern Life Affects Air Quality**

Many of our activities can result in air pollution. Our main sources of air pollution are vehicles, power stations and refineries.

To keep our air quality good, we review our air emission standards for industries and vehicles regularly and benchmark ourselves against major cities around the world.

For example, to reduce PM2.5 emissions from diesel vehicles, our main contributor to PM2.5 levels, stricter Euro V emission standards will be mandated for all new diesel motor vehicles from 1 Jan 2014.


**Our Efforts:: Keeping a Close Eye on Air Quality**

*MANAGEMENT OF AIR QUALITY IN SINGAPORE*

Stringent measures have been put in place to ensure that Singapore maintains good air quality. From the planning stage, such as locating pollutive industries away from residential areas, down to mandating and enforcing strict emission standards, we have been careful to calibrate our air pollution control measures to strike a fine balance between supporting economic development and ensuring a high quality of life. These measures have served Singapore well over the past five decades, as can be seen by our good ambient air quality record.

 *24-HOUR AIR QUALITY MONITORING NETWORK*

The ambient air in Singapore is monitored through a network of air monitoring stations located in different parts of Singapore. The monitoring stations measure concentration levels of particulate matter (PM10), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and carbon monoxide (CO). These six pollutant parameters determine the Pollutant Standards Index (PSI).  

The state of air quality has an impact on our health and quality of life.

As such, the 24-hour Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) readings of the 5 regions of Singapore are reported every hour on the  [Haze microsite](http://www.haze.gov.sg/home), and myENV  [iPhone](http://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/myenv/id444435182)  and  [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sg.gov.nea&hl=en)  app. The 24-hour and 1-hour PM2.5, 24-hour PM10, 24-hour SO2, 8-hour CO, 8-hour O3  and 1-hour NO2  concentration levels are also published every hour on the  [NEA website](http://www.nea.gov.sg/anti-pollution-radiation-protection/air-pollution-control/psi/pollutant-concentrations).

*ACHIEVING HIGHER AIR QUALITY STANDARDS*

MEWR has adopted the World Health Organisation (WHO) Air Quality Guidelines (AQG) for particulate matter (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and ozone (O3), and the WHO Interim Targets for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and sulphur dioxide (SO2), as Singapore’s air quality targets for 2020. To attain these air quality targets by 2020, abatement measures are being implemented to reduce emissions from vehicles and industries.

## About Haze


Haze not only gives our island a blurry facade, it could cause serious health effects over time.

You could sneeze or cough more often and your eyes might be irritated. The elderly, children and individuals with existing heart or lung disease are most sensitive to the effects of haze. Haze can lead to impairment of respiratory functions and aggravation of existing respiratory and cardiovascular disease.

**The Challenge**

Practising open burning to clear land for agricultural uses is common in certain areas in the region. The vastness of the land makes it difficult for local authorities to police this practice.

A combination of dry season, wind direction, cloud formation and poor precipitation formation creates haze. Thus haze could potentially occur at any time of the year.

Prevailing winds sometimes carry smoke produced by the forest fires across to Singapore. Such instances are particularly likely during the Southwest Monsoon Season.

**Our Efforts**

*BANDING TOGETHER TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION*

Singapore works closely with ASEAN to manage the haze issue. Some of our efforts include sharing satellite pictures of hotspots and sending our men to help fight fires.

*A HAZE ACTION PLAN IN PLACE*

We have in place a set of measures and procedures to activate in the event of serious haze levels.

*SUGGESTIONS FOR HOMES AND OFFICES*

NEA has compiled a list of air cleaning devices for  [buildings with central air-conditioning system](http://www.nea.gov.sg/anti-pollution-radiation-protection/air-pollution/psi/air-cleaning-devices).

*TIMELY UPDATES FOR THE PUBLIC*

The 24-hr PSI readings by the 5 regions of Singapore are made available on the myEnv  [iPhone](http://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/myenv/id444435182)  and  [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sg.gov.nea&hl=en)  app,  [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/NEAsg)  account and  [website](http://www.nea.gov.sg/).

## About Noise Pollution

Excessive noise can affect our quality of life. However, noise cannot be avoided completely as we become more urbanised and densely populated.

**The Challenge: Higher Density, More Noise**

Singapore is a small and densely populated city-state with an average of over 7,000 residents in each square kilometre of land.

Given our land constraint, there is a limit on setback distances and land buffers that we can provide to keep noise sources such as road and rail traffic away from residential areas.

A balance between meeting residents' expectations and the realities of a densely populated Singapore needs to be carefully maintained in the long run.

**Our Efforts - Regulating Noise**

NEA controls noise from construction sites and factories by stipulating maximum permissible noise levels for different times of day and night.

Daytime - 65 Decibels
Evening - 60 Decibels
Night - 55 Decibels

The noise limits also vary according to the sensitivity of the areas to noise. Noise standards for in-use vehicles are also in place under the Environmental Protection and Management Regulations.

From October 2007, maximum permissible noise limits were tightened for construction sites located within 150m of residential or noise sensitive areas for night-time and on Sundays and Public Holidays. In September 2011, NEA further introduced a no-work rule, prohibiting construction activities on Sundays and Public Holidays. The rule covers all new constructions sites commencing work on or after 1 September 2011, and located within 150m of residential or noise sensitive premises such as hospitals and schools.
