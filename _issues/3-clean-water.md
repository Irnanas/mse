<h1><b>Our Clean Water Policy in a Nutshell</b></h1>

<p><strong>ENSURING WATER SUPPLY FOR ALL</strong><br>	Singapore depends on four sources for its water supply – local catchment water, imported water, NEWater and desalinated water. Known as the Four National Taps, this diversified water supply strategy ensures Singaporeans of a robust supply of water for generations to come.</p>

<p><strong>CONSERVING OUR WATER RESOURCES</strong><br>  While we can continue to expand our supply, we also look at ways to manage demand and conserve our precious water resources. As our population and economy grows, we need to use water wisely to ensure sustainability.</p>  

<p><strong>ENCOURAGING OWNERSHIP OF OUR WATERS</strong><br>  Besides ensuring the cleanliness and health of our waterway network, we encourage Singaporeans to take joint ownership of water by using it wisely and keeping our waterways, waterbodies and catchment areas clean.</p>


<h2 id="our-key-targets">Our Key Targets</h2>
<ol>
	<li><p>Increase supply of water from non-conventional sources such as desalination and water recycling to meet up to 30% and 50% of our future water needs by 2060.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>Reduce daily per capita domestic water consumption to 147 litres by 2020, and 140 litres by 2030.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>Partner the 3P sectors to generate greater awareness of the importance of conserving, valuing and enjoying water and develop a sense of shared ownership of our water resources.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="our-main-plans">Our Main Plans</h2>
<div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title1"  /><label for="title1">Providing water for all</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>We rely on a few different water sources to help ensure that our supply remains stable at all times. To improve the sustainability of our water supply, we promote research and development efforts in water and used water technologies. We also ensure that our potable water quality is of high standards.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title2"  /><label for="title2">Encouraging water conservation</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>On top of securing supply, we seek to reduce water consumption of both households and non-domestic sectors. We actively promote the use of water-efficient household fittings and appliances and continue to work with various non-domestic sectors to manage their water demand.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title3"  /><label for="title3">Educating on the value of water</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>We encourage the community to improve their water-using habits and educate them on the implications of living in water catchment areas.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title4"  /><label for="title4">Enjoying our water resources</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Our water resources also provide recreational spaces. Singaporeans are encouraged to take ownership of them while enjoying these resources.</p>

<h2>Water Conservation</h2>
<div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title5"  /><label for="title5">Water is Precious</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Singapore is a small island. We do not have aquifers or groundwater. We rely on rain as a source of water but we cannot afford to use large areas of land to collect and store rainwater.</p>
		<p>To overcome these limitations, we strive to be as efficient and innovative as possible to ensure that we have enough to meet our needs.</p>
		<p>Our Four National Taps are: Local catchment water, NEWater, Imported water and desalinated water.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title6"  /><label for="title6">The Challenge: Taking Water for Granted</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p><em>Increasing Demand and Climate Change</em></p>
		<p>The demand for water is expected to double in the next 50 years, Coupled with the uncertainty of weather patterns in the face of climate change, we cannot take it for granted that we will always have enough water.</p>
		<p><em>Wasteful Habits</em></p>
		<p>In Singapore, we are lucky to have easy access to clean water from the taps. However, this also makes it easy for us to end up using more water than we really need on a daily basis. When clean water comes at the turn of a tap, it is easy to waste water without noticing.</p>
		<p><em>Unrepaired Leaks</em></p>
		<p>Water wastage from pipes or water appliances often goes unnoticed as well. Loose tap fittings, malfunctioning toilet cisterns and leaking water pipes can all lead to a huge waste of water.</p>
		<p>For instance, a typical leak from a kitchen can amount to 10,000 litres per year, which is over 6600 large bottles.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title7"  /><label for="title7">Our Efforts</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p><em>Water Conservation Education and Outreach</em></p>
		<p>PUB conducts community outreach efforts to raise awareness. The annual Water Conservation Awareness Programme sends volunteers to households with high water consumption to install water saving devices and share water saving tips. Participating households save up to 5% of their monthly water consumption. PUB’s 10% Challenge benefits the non-domestic sector by encouraging businesses to cut down 10% of their monthly water consumption, which also lowers their operational costs.</p>
		<p><em>Preventing and Detecting Leaks</em></p>
		<p>PUB replaces ageing water mains and pipes over the years to minimise leaks. Regular checks are also conducted on water meter readings to spot leaks.</p>
		<p><em>Pricing Value to Reflect Its True Value</em></p>
		<p>The use  of sound economic principles in pricing water is important to keep demand and supply in balance. Under-pricing water leads to over-consumption. As such, the price of water in Singapore comprises what is needed to recover the cost of production and supply and a Water Conservation Tax to reflect the scarcity of water and the importance of conserving it.</p>
		<p><em>Funding Water Efficient Measures</em></p>
		<p>PUB’s Water Efficiency Fund (WEF) co-funds organisations, companies and community groups to implement water saving initiatives.</p>

<h2>About Our Water Supply</h2>
<div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title8"  /><label for="title8">Water - A Precious Resource</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>A sunny island set in the sea, Singapore depends  on rain as a natural source of water. We receive plenty of rain but we are constrained bu our land area which limits our storage space for water. Singapore has NO large rivers, natural springs or glaciers.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title9"  /><label for="title9">The Challenge: Demand for Water Expected to Increase</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Through careful planning, we have been able to grow our water supply to meet our needs over the years. Nevertheless, we have to continue planning ahead, innovating and investing in research and development.</p>
		<p>Water demand is expected to double over the next 50 years.</p>
		<p>To meet this growing need - a result of projected increases in industrial activity and population growth - we have to tap on new sources of water and more efficient treatment processes.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title10"  /><label for="title10">Our Efforts</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>The total number of reservoirs in Singapore is 17. Together with the Marina Reservoir, they increase the water catchment areas from half to two-thirds of Singapore.</p>
		<p>The reservoirs are accompanied by 32 major rivers and more than 7000km of canals and drains for our water supply.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<a id="reservoirs"></a>

<h2>About Our Reservoirs</h2>
<div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title11"  /><label for="title11">We Only Have Rainwater</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Singapore does not have any significant, accessible natural aquifers, which are layers of underground rock that are able to hold water. Instead, we rely on reservoirs for collecting and storing rainwater.</p>
		<p>To make the best use of the rainfall we receive, the water catchment area in Singapore has been progressively expanded over the years. An extensive network of drains, canals, rivers and storm water ponds collects and channels rainwater to our reservoirs for storage.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title12"  /><label for="title12">The Challenges</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p><em>Difficult to Create New Reservoirs</em></p>
		<p>All major estuaries in Singapore have already been dammed up to create reservoirs. While we still have some untapped streams and rivulets near the coastline, they are too small to dam up as reservoirs.</p>
		<p><em>Rainfall Patterns are Unpredictable</em></p>
		<p>Climate change may affect rainfall patterns. This makes it difficult to make plans to meet the water needs of our population and economy.</p>
		<p><em>Possible Pollution from Urban Development</em></p>
		<p>Singapore’s small size means that much of our urban development is near or within water catchment areas. Many human activities produce pollutants that can be carried via the drainage system into our reservoirs when it rains.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title13"  /><label for="title13">Our Efforts</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Apart from serving as water collection and storage spaces, our reservoirs also provide valuable recreational space.</p>
		<p>Some reservoirs are now open to a variety of water sports such as canoeing, dragon-boating, kayaking and sailing.</p>
		<p><em>Keeping Our Water Clean</em></p>
		<p>We have put in place measures to keep our reservoirs clean. For example, an underground wall was built along the former Lorong Halus landfill, which forms part of the bank of Serangoon Reservoir. The wall prevents water from the landfill from entering the reservoir.</p>
		<p><em>Seeking Cooperation from Public and Private Sectors</em></p>
		<p>We rely on everyone to help keep our water clean. Construction companies have to ensure that soil does not get washed into our drains from worksites and factories have to ensure that waste chemicals are not discharged into our drains. Individuals also have to help keep our drains, rivers and reservoirs clean by not littering.</p>

<h2>About Our Waterways</h2>
<div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title14"  /><label for="title14">Collecting Rainwater to Drink</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Rainwater is an important source of water for Singapore and forms one of our Four National Taps.</p>
		<p>Two-thirds of Singapore is currently water catchment area. Rainwater that falls within the water catchments is collected and channelled via a network of drains and stormwater canals to one of our 17 reservoirs for storage before being treated for potable use.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title15"  /><label for="title15">The Challenge: Keeping Our Rainwater Clean</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>While we have separate systems to collect rainwater and used water, it is still a challenge to keep the rainwater we collect clean.</p>
		<p>The increasingly urbanised nature of our water catchment areas means that rainwater runoff is at increasing risk of being polluted by things such as oil and silt.</p>
		<p>Urbanisation also makes our waterways and reservoirs more accessible, exposing them to inconsiderate actions such as littering.</p>
		<p>Contamination makes it more costly to process and supply clean water to our taps.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title16"  /><label for="title16">Our Efforts: Maintaing Good Water Quality</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Our waterways are cleaned regularly. We use float booms and litter traps to prevent litter from entering our reservoirs. Beyond this, everyone has a part to play in keeping our waterways clean and free from pollutants.</p>
		<p><em>Working Closely with Industries</em></p>
		<p>PUB puts in place regulations for industry players to ensure that waste is properly disposed and substances such as silt and chemicals are not washed into waterways.</p>
		<p><em>ABC Waters Programme</em></p>
		<p>Our waterways and reservoirs have been transformed under PUB’s Active, Beautiful, Clean (ABC) Waters Programme into recreational spaces which people can value and enjoy. Certain design features such as plants can also help to clean the rainwater in our waterways.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<a id="desalination"></a>

<h2>Desalination</h2>
<div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title17"  /><label for="title17">Our Natural Sources of Fresh Water are Limited</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Desalination is the removal of excessive salt and minerals from seawater to make it potable.</p>
		<p>Technological advances have made it viable for Singapore to use desalination as one of our Four National Taps since 2005. In Singapore, desalination is done through a process called reverse osmosis, which separates water from excessive salts and minerals. As desalination is not dependent on rainfall, it makes our water supply more stable regardless of weather conditions.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title18"  /><label for="title18">The Challenge: High Energy Usage and Potential Environmental Impact</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p><em>Desalinated Water is Costly</em></p>
		<p>Compared to treating rainwater to produce potable water, desalination is energy-intensive and relies on advanced membrane technology. This makes desalination a relatively expensive option.</p>
		<p><em>Potential Impact on Marine Environment</em></p>
		<p>After extracting fresh water from the sea water, the concentrated salt water and remaining minerals such as boron are discharged back into the sea. Enhanced mixing of the plant discharge with the surrounding seawater ensures that the concentration of salt and minerals will not adversely affect the marine habitats near the discharge points.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title19"  /><label for="title19">Our Efforts: Technology Provides Solution</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p><em>Selecting The Right Technology</em></p>
		<p>To ensure that our desalination processes are as energy-efficient as possible, reverse osmosis membrane technology is used as it is reliable and efficient.</p>
		<p>Both of our desalination plants are also public-private partnership (PPP) projects which enables us to tap on and grow private sector expertise to reap efficiencies in cost and technology.</p>
		<p><em>Limiting The Environmental Impact</em></p>
		<p>We closely monitor the quality of sea water surrounding our desalination plants to make sure there is minimal impact on the marine environment.</p>

<h2>Our Beach Water Quality</h2>
<div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title20"  /><label for="title20">Beach Water can be Harmful</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Beach water is vulnerable to contamination from pollutants. During water activities at the beach, we will come into contact with seawater and may ingest it accidentally. Should the water quality be poor or contaminated this may lead to gastrointestinal and respiratory illness.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title21"  /><label for="title21">The Challenge: Many Factors Affect the Quality of Beach Water</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Many sources of pollution to monitor: Minor leakage from older sewers, Sea Animals and Discharges from moored vessels</p>
		<p><em>Changing Tides Present Different Challenges</em></p>
		<p>While our beaches are cleaned regularly, changing tidal conditions make the task more challenging. During the north-east and south-west monsoons, more floating refuse and debris is washed ashore from the open sea. This requires greater effort in removal.</p>
		<p><em>Beach Goers Must Play Their Part</em></p>
		<p>While beach goers enjoy their time at the beach, they should take care not to leave rubbish behind when they leave, which could contribute to the pollution of beach water.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title22"  /><label for="title22">Our Efforts: Setting Standards, Monitoring and Cleaning Up</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Water samples are collected and tested by NEA weekly at monitored recreational beaches. These tests help ensure that our beach water quality meets our recreational water quality guidelines.</p>
		<p>Singapore's recreational water quality guidelines are adopted from World Health Organisation guidelines for Safe Recreational Waters. The local guidelines were established in 2008 after a careful study of the WHO guidelines, analysis of data gathered over a few years, and consultation and collaboration with other relevant agencies.</p>
		<p>NEA also has regular cleaning regimes for our beaches.</p>

<a id="flash-floods"></a>

<h2>Flash Floods</h2>
<div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title23"  /><label for="title23">Unexpectedly Intense Rainfall</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>We have an extensive drainage system comprising 7,000km of drains and canals that channel rainwater to our reservoirs or the sea. Most times, our drains are able to cope with the rain that we receive. However, intense bouts of rainfall can sometimes exceed the capacity that the drains are designed for, resulting in flash floods. These floods are localised and generally subside in under an hour.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title24"  /><label for="title24">The Challenge: Human Enginnering VS Unpredictable Weather </label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p><em>Reviewing Our Drainage System</em></p>
		<p>In recent years, weather and rainfall patterns have become increasingly unpredictable. While our drainage system has served us well for decades, we need to examine our options carefully to see how else we can expand or improve on it to cope with these new challenges.</p>
		<p><em>Preparing Ourselves Against Damage</em></p>
		<p>The Ministry recognises that flash floods can be very disruptive. We have put in place measures to protect human safety as well as work with building and property owners to ensure that their premises have sufficient flood protection to limit the dangers.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title25"  /><label for="title25">Our Efforts: Safety First, Study in the Works</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p><em>Safety A Top Concern</em></p>
		<p>The Ministry has made human safety top priority. We have installed railings at more open drains, especially in flood-prone and low-lying areas, among other measures to protect public safety.</p>
		<p><em>Experts Reviewed Drainage Planning Norms and Flood Protection Measures</em></p>
		<p>On June 30, 2011, the Ministry appointed an Expert Panel on Drainage Design and Flood Protection Measures to conduct an in-depth review of our drainage system, management approach and flood protection measures.</p>
		<p>The Ministry and PUB have accepted the panel's recommendations, released in January 2012. The recommendations include implementing a wider range of drainage solutions and improving the flood warning system.</p>
