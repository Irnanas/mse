<h1><b>Our Clean Energy Policy in a Nutshell</b></h1>

<p><strong>EDUCATING SINGAPOREANS ABOUT ENERGY AND CLIMATE CHANGE</strong><br>  We encourage stakeholders in Singapore to learn about climate change, and learn how they can play their part to prevent it. Carbon emissions made up around 95% of our total greenhouse gas emissions in 2014. These emissions cause more heat to be trapped into the atmosphere, leading to climate change. Energy consumption is one of the main sources of carbon in Singapore. Our industrial and commercial activities, transport systems and household appliances all run on electricity and fossil fuel.</p>

<p><strong>PREPARING TO COPE WITH CLIMATE CHANGE</strong><br>  Singapore experiences the effects of climate change along with the rest of the world. The build-up of carbon dioxide - among other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere - makes our weather hotter and raises the sea level around us. Our role is to increase understanding of the science and impacts of climate change and keep Singapore prepared.</p>

<p><strong>LOOKING FOR WAYS TO CUT OUR EMISSIONS</strong><br>  A vibrant Singapore relies on readily available energy.
However, we are constantly looking for ways to continue producing and consuming energy in an environmentally-responsible way.</p>

<p><strong>COOPERATING WITH INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS</strong><br>  While climate change is a global challenge, Singapore remains committed to doing our part as a responsible member of the global community to tackle climate change.</p>

<h2>Energy Efficiency And Conservation</h2>
<div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title5"  /><label for="title5">Consuming Energy Contributes To Climate Change And Air Pollution</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>When fuel is combusted, whether in a power plant, a vehicle engine or an industrial facility, waste products such as carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrous oxides and soot are created.</p>
		<p>Carbon dioxide is the major contributor to climate change, while the other pollutants dirty the air and can affect our health and well-being.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title6"  /><label for="title6">The Challenge: Reducing Pollution Without Bringing Singapore To A Standstill</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Many positive things are made possible through energy. Energy is essential for our day-to-day living and powers our industries, commercial and transport activities. However, we need to ensure that this precious resource is used wisely and its negative by-products are well managed.</p>
		<p>As our nation develops and population grows, our energy consumption has also gone up.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title7"  /><label for="title7">Our Efforts: Making The Most Out Of Energy</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Energy conservation does not mean changing lifestyles drastically. It encourages the using of energy in a smarter way to achieve the same results with less energy. Not only does it reduce carbon emissions and pollutants, but enables us to achieve savings in our utility bills.</p>
		<p>The Energy Efficiency Programme Office (E<sup>2</sup>PO) is a multi-agency committee set up to improve energy efficiency across many different types of activities, such as: Households, Industry, Buildings, Power Generation, Transport and Infocomm.</p>
		<p>Apart from direct measures, we work to find innovative technologies to drive energy efficiency.</p>
		<p>For more information on energy efficiency initiatives in Singapore, head to <a href="https://www.e2singapore.gov.sg">Energy Efficient Singapore!</a></p>
		<p><em>Improved Energy Efficiency</em></p>
		<p>Although our electricity consumption has grown over the years, we are achieving more growth with each unit of energy used. This means that for every dollar of growth we are achieving, we are using less energy and generate less greenhouse gases and pollution.</p>
		<p><em>Energy Conservation Act</em></p>
		<p>One important tool in our efforts is the Energy Conservation Act. The Act requires large energy users in the industry and transport sectors to appoint energy managers, report energy use, and put in place good energy management practices. The Act also sets out minimum energy performance standards for industrial equipment and household appliances.</p>

<h2>Clean Energy</h2>
<div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title8"  /><label for="title8">Using Clean Energy Helps Combat Climate Change</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>The use of conventional energy sources such as fossil fuels to power Singapore results in the emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. This also contributes to climate change.</p>
		<p>Clean energy sources can help us meet our energy needs while minimising the environmental impact.</p>
		<p>However, our small land area, geographical location and other physical attributes make it hard for us to adopt other kinds of energy sources. We are dependent on fossil fuel imports for our energy needs and have limited access to alternative energy sources.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title9"  /><label for="title9">The Challenge: Difficulties In Increasing Use Of Clean Energy</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Singapore is an "alternative energy-disadvantaged" country, as recognised under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). We lack the natural characteristics necessary to make use of non-fossil alternatives such as hydroelectricity, wind energy and geothermal energy.</p>
		<p>Solar power is one possible renewable energy source we can adopt but there are many factors affecting its viability:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>limited land and rooftop space for deployment;</p>
			</li>
			<li><p>amount of cloud cover and humidity;</p>
			</li>
			<li><p>overall efficiency of the technology;</p>

	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p><em>Switching to Less-Carbon Intensive Fuels</em></p>
		<p>While we cannot completely do without conventional energy sources, we are using more natural gas, which is the cleanest of fossil fuels, to cut down our emissions.</p>
		<p><em>Exploring The Use Of Solar Energy In Housing Estate And Beyond</em></p>
		<p>Test-bedding solar energy is a whole-of-Singapore effort. The HDB has begun test-bedding solar energy since April 2009, installing solar panels in 30 housing estates across the island over 5 years. There is also an existing test-bed on Marina Barrage, the Met Service’s Centre for Climate Research Singapore (CCRS), as well as at various government facilities.</p>
		<p>PUB is also in the process of implementing three floating solar photovoltaic (PV) systems on Bedok, Lower Seletar and Tengeh Reservoirs. The large-scale floating solar PV system at Tengeh Reservoir, will be one of the world’s largest inland floating solar PV systems, which will generate sufficient energy to power local water treatment plants.</p>

<h2>Climate Change</h2>
<div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title11"  /><label for="title11">The Earth Is Getting Warmer</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>The build-up of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere has trapped more heat - resulting in a warmer planet. Temperatures on Earth have been rising at about 0.13°C per decade over the past 50 years.</p>
		<p>A warmer climate leads to the thermal expansion of the sea and melting of glaciers and ice caps, which lead to rising sea levels.</p>
		<p>Along with the rest of the world, Singapore experiences the effects of climate change.</p>

		<p><em>International Commitment</em></p>
		<p>The causes and impacts of climate change are global issues that require international cooperation. Singapore is committed to doing our part in the global effort to address climate change</p>
		<p><em>Gearing Up For Climate Change</em></p>
		<p>We wrok with partners from the government and research community to better understand our geographic features. We also look into the science of climate and weather. The Meteorological Service's Centre for Climate Research Singapore (CCRS), established in 2012, will act as a national focal point for climate and weather studies.</p>
		<p><em>Working With Partners Across The Government</em></p>
		<p>The National Climate Change Secretariat (NCSS) was set up as a dedicated agency under the Prime Minister's Office with effect from 1 July 2010 to coordinate Singapore's domestic and international policies, plans and actions on climate change.</p>

<h2>Carbon Emissions</h2>
<div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title14"  /><label for="title14">Carbon Emissions Contribute To Climate Change</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Carbon emissions make up 97% of our total greenhouse gas emissions. These emissions cause more heat to be trapped into the atmosphere, leading to climate change.</p>
		<p>Singapore experiences the effects of climate change along with the rest of the world. The build-up of carbon dioxide, among other greenhouse gases, in the atmosphere makes our weather hotter and raises the sea level around us.</p>
		<p>Reducing our carbon emissions is one important way we can limit the effects of climate change in the coming decades.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title15"  /><label for="title15">The Challenge: Almost Everything We Do Emits Carbon</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Energy consumption is one of the main sources of carbon in Singapore. Our household appliances, transport systems, industrial and commercial activities all run on electricity and fuel. A vibrant Singapore relies on consuming electricity.</p>
		<p>However, as carbon dioxide is invisible and the negative effects of climate change take a long time to show, it is easy for people to consume electricity without realising the consequences.</p>
		<p><em>We Are Part Of Global Action On Carbon Emissions</em></p>
		<p>Singapore contributes around 0.1% of global emissions.</p>
		<p>To achieve a significant cut in global carbon emissions, concerted international effort is required. But this does not mean there is nothing we can do to help.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title16"  /><label for="title16">Our Efforts</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p><em>Participating In Global Efforts</em></p>
		<p>As a responsible member of the global community, Singapore has pledged to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 16% below Business-as-Usual levels in 2020. The pledge, announced in 2010 ahead of the UNFCCC Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, was conditional on a legally binding global agreement.</p>
		<p>We also ratified the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1997 and acceded to the Kyoto Protocol in 2006.</p>
		<p><em>Switching To Less Carbon Intensive Fuels</em></p>
		<p>Out of the many types of fossil fuels, natural gas emits 40% less carbon dioxide than fuel oil for every unit of electricity generated.</p>
		<p>Over the years Singapore has switched from fuel oil to using more natural gas. This means we can continue to power Singapore while emitting less carbon than we would have, using fuel oil.</p>
		<p><em>Improving Our Energy Efficiency</em></p>
		<p>Aside from power generation, we are also working to become "energy efficient". Energy efficiency means achieving more while consuming less.</p>
		<p>The Efficiency Programme Office (E<sup>2</sup>PO) drives energy efficiency across many different types of activities. For example, the use of public transport is encouraged, allowing Singaporeans to get from place to place while using relatively less energy.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title17"  /><label for="title17">Carbon Tax</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>The carbon tax is an important step to sustain our clean, green and liveable environment, and to help us transform into a low-carbon economy. It complements the suite of measures that Singapore is undertaking to fight climate change, and will help us meet our commitments under the Paris Agreement, where we pledged to reduce our emissions intensity by 36% from 2005 levels by 2030, and to stabilise our emissions with the aim of peaking around 2030.</p>
		<p>The Minister for Finance announced at Budget 2017, Singapore’s plan to introduce a carbon tax from 2019. The tax will be applied on facilities that emit more than 25,000 tCO2e of emissions annually, and cover the six greenhouse gases (GHGs) that Singapore currently reports to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as part of our national GHG inventory.</p>
		<p>The carbon tax will put in place a uniform and economy-wide price signal to incentivise emitters to reduce their emissions, while giving them the flexibility to take action in the most economically efficient way. To give the industry more time to adjust and implement energy efficiency projects, the tax will start at $5/tCO2e in the first instance, from 2019 to 2023. The Government will review the tax rate by 2023. We intend to increase the tax to between $10-$15/ tCO2e by 2030. In doing so, we will take into account international climate change developments, the progress of our emissions mitigation efforts, and our economic competitiveness.</p>
		<p>The first payment of the carbon tax will be in 2020, based on emissions in calendar year 2019. The impact on households and most businesses will be small, leading to an increase of around 1% in electricity prices. An additional $20 in the annual U-Save Rebates will be provided to all eligible HDB households over a period of 3 years, starting from 2019, to offset the expected increase in utilities expenses. The Government will also enhance support for companies, including SMEs and power generation companies, to improve energy efficiency.</p>
		<p><em>Carbon Pricing Bill</em></p>
		<p>The Carbon Pricing Bill was passed on 20 March 2018 and will give effect to the carbon tax in 2019 once in force. The Bill sets out the overall carbon tax framework and obligations for large GHG emitters, including the measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) requirements. The Bill will also provide powers for the Minister of the Environment and Water Resources to make and amend related regulations for matters such as the MRV requirements for affected facilities. You may view the Bill <a href="https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Bills-Supp/17-2018/Published/20180302?DocDate=20180302">here.</a></p>
		<p><em>Public Consultations</em></p>
		<p>Public consultations were held as part of engagement efforts by Government agencies to consult stakeholders on the carbon tax.</p>
