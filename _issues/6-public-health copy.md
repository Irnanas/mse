<h1><b>Our Public Health Policy in a Nutshell</b></h1>

<p><strong>MAINTAING A GOOD QUALITY OF LIFE</strong><br>  Public health standards contribute to the quality of life. High public health standards reflect a safe environment for Singaporeans to work and play.</p>

<p><strong>CONTROLLING VECTOR POPULATION TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH</strong><br>  Vectors spread diseases among the population by carrying viruses from one person to another. The control of vectors, especially mosquitoes, is one important way of protecting Singaporeans from diseases.</p>

<p><strong>PROTECTING THE PUBLIC FROM SECOND HEALTH SMOKE</strong><br>  To protect Singaporeans from the harmful effects of second-hand smoke, the smoking ban was first introduced in October 1970. It has been progressively extended over the years to cover many public places.</p>

<h2 id="our-key-targets">Our Key Targets</h2>
<ol>
	<li><p>Maintain a low incidence of vector-borne and food-borne diseases.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>Become a leading regional centre in epidemiological surveillance and research on vector-borne diseases.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<a id="smoking"></a>

<h2>Smoking</h2>
<div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title3"  /><label for="title3">Smoking Harms Not Only The Smoker</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Smoking harms the health of the smoker. Not only that, people exposed to second-hand smoke in public places are also at risk of the ill effects of smoking.</p>
		<p>There are at least 60 cancer-causing chemicals in second-hand smoke. Non-smokers who are exposed to second-hand smoke face higher risks of lung cancer, respiratory tract infections, heart disease as well as eye, nose and throat irritations.</p>
		<p>Studies have also shown that pregnant women exposed to second-hand smoke are more likely to have miscarriages or stillbirths.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title4"  /><label for="title4">The Challenge: Cooperation From Smokers Necessary To Protect Public Health</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Although less than 15% of Singaporean adults are smokers, anyone in a public space with smokers can be affected by the effects of smoking.</p>
		<p>The Ministry takes measure to protect the health of non-smokers through the smoking prohibition act.</p>
		<p>Besides having laws in place, smokers must also take responsibility for their own actions and be considerate towards others.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title5"  /><label for="title5">Our Efforts: Creating A Smoke-Free Environment</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p><em>Greater Enforcement Of Ban</em></p>
		<p>The NEA has stepped up its efforts to enforce the smoking ban by conducting daily patrols of various places, including 24-hour food and entertainment outlets. Members of the public can also report smoking violations via NEA's 24-hour call centre or its iPhone app, myENV.</p>
		<p><em>Extending The Smoking Ban To More Areas</em></p>
		<p>Efforts to protect non-smokers from second-home smoke began in 1970 when smoking was banned in cinemas, theatres and on omnibuses. Since then, the ban has been extended to cover 37 types of premises, particularly those where it is harder for non-smokers to avoid second-hand smoke. There have been increasing calls from the public to extend the smoking ban to more areas. The smoking ban now covers most areas where non-smokers are unable to avoid and will eventually be extended to all public places except designated smoking areas. This will be implemented incrementally, taking into account feedback from public and relevant stakeholders.</p>
		<p>In Jan 2013, the smoking ban was extended to include common areas of residential buildings (such as common corridors, void decks, staircases, stairwells, as well as multi-purpose halls) covered walkways/ link ways, pedestrian overhead bridges, 5-metre radius from the edge of bus shelters, and hospital outdoor compounds.</p>
		<p>From 1 Jun 2016, the smoking prohibition was further extended to the following areas: reservoirs, parks under the purview of JTC Corporation and parks in public housing estates managed by the respective Town Councils, and parks in private landed estates managed by NParks.</p>

<h2>Dengue</h2>
<div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title6"  /><label for="title6">Dengue Can Be Fatal If Untreated</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>The female Aedes aegypti mosquito is the primary vector of dengue in Singapore. When an Aedes mosquito bites an infected person, it can pick up the virus and pass it to the next person it bites. <a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/dengue-zika/Aedes">View the map</a> showing areas with relatively higher Aedes aegypti mosquito population, and thus higher risk of dengue transmission.</p>
		<p>Residents living in areas with relatively higher Aedes aegypti mosquito populations are urged to help reduce the mosquito population by regularly practising the Mozzie Wipeout.</p>
		<p>The more severe forms of dengue can be fatal if not treated.</p>
		<p>Learn how you can prevent Aedes mosquito breeding at the National Environment Agency (NEA)'s <a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/dengue-zika/dengue">dengue webpage</a></p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title7"  /><label for="title7">The Challenge: Mosquitoes Breed Easily In Our Environment</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>The Aedes mosquito breeds in stagnant water in man-made habitats. These can be easily found in our environment – such as pails and containers in our homes, tree holes and drains outdoor. Our tropical climate is also conducive to the maturation of the mosquito.</p>
		<p><em> The Disease Is Constantly Among Us</em></p>
		<p>Dengue is endemic in Singapore and the region. This means that the disease is always present, even if it is not always at high levels. To prevent disease transmission, it is important for us to keep mosquito numbers as low as possible at all times.</p>
		<p><em>Receive Alerts On Areas With Higher Aedes Aegypti Mosquito Populations</em></p>
		<p>Download the myENV app and view the Aedes Mosquitoes map, showing areas with relatively high Aedes aegypti mosquito populations. Add locations on the myENV app and set up notifications for Aedes mosquitoes. You will be notified if one of your locations is in an area with higher Aedes population.</p>
		<p>Download the myENV app for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/myenv/id444435182">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sg.gov.nea&hl=en">Android.</a></p>

<h2>Vector Control</h2>
<div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title12"  /><label for="title12">Some Pests Can Carry Diseases That Affect Us</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Pests that can carry diseases are also referred to as vectors. Given Singapore’s high population density, any outbreak of vector-borne diseases is likely to spread rapidly. NEA monitors the vector population to make sure that vector-borne diseases here are kept under control.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title13"  /><label for="title13">The Challenge: Vectors Are Here To Stay</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p><em>Tougher, Adaptable Agents Of Disease</em></p>
		<p>Due to the loss of their original habitats from rapid urbanisation, these vectors have quickly adopted alternative breeding grounds in built-up areas. Coupled with increased resistance to pesticides, it is almost impossible to get rid of vectors completely.</p>
		<p><em>New Vector-Borne Diseases</em></p>
		<p>Air travel and trade means that new vector-borne diseases can spread to Singapore through visiting travellers or returning locals.</p>
		<p><em>Favourable Climate For Breeding</em></p>
		<p>With climate change, increases in temperature and rainfall are expected. This may result in vectors thriving in new locations and maturing faster.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title14"  /><label for="title14">Our Efforts: From Reaction To Prevention</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p><em>Surveillance And Control</em></p>
		<p>NEA maintains a close watch on the rodent population to keep it under control. Since 01 June 2011, NEA's vector control technicians (VCTs) conduct systematic inspections of both HDB and non-HDB estates island-wide as part of a dedicated rodent surveillance and control team under NEA. Between 2005 and 2007, NEA co-funded a dedicated rodent control programme for HDB estates, termed "Rat Attack". There were three phases in the programme.</p>
		<p>For mosquitoes, NEA officers visit premises at least once every 3 to 6 months to check for potential breeding spots and remove existing breeding grounds. NEA also carries out virus surveillance on patient blood samples submitted by healthcare providers, to track the different variations of the dengue virus circulating in the community.</p>
		<p><em>Keeping Dengue At Bay</em></p>
		<p>While we cannot get rid of vectors completely, we have successfully kept outbreaks of diseases at bay.</p>
		<p>Since its set up in 2002, NEA’s Environmental Health Institute (EHI) has been conducting research, surveillance and risk assessments on vector-borne diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and malaria. Accurate and rapid diagnosis of such diseases is important as it helps to minimise the chances of transmission.</p>
