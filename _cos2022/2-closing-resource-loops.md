## Closing our resource loops

In line with the Singapore Green Plan 2030â€™s goal of reducing the amount of waste sent to landfill and encouraging sustainable habits, the National Environment Agency (NEA) will be implementing a minimum charge for disposable carrier bags at supermarkets. Starting mid-2023, large supermarkets will be required to charge a minimum of five cents for each disposable carrier bag provided for purchases made at their physical stores.

A recycling container will be distributed to households in 2022 to encourage everyone to recycle. 

Producers of e-waste are now required to collect and treat their products at end-of-life. 3,500 tonnes of consumer e-waste have been collected for recycling and extraction of valuable materials since July 2021.
