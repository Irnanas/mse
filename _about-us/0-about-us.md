**The Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE)** is committed to providing Singaporeans with a clean and sustainable environment, and resilient supplies of safe food and water. MSE works alongside its three statutory boards – the [National Environment Agency (NEA)](https://www.nea.gov.sg/), [PUB, Singapore’s National Water Agency](https://www.pub.gov.sg/), and the [Singapore Food Agency (SFA)](https://www.sfa.gov.sg/) – to achieve this mission through innovation, technology, and vibrant partnerships with the private, public and people (3P) sectors.

MSE’s key priorities are to ensure a sustainable, resource-efficient and climate-resilient Singapore. Our three strategic directions include economic resilience, resource resilience and climate resilience.

**Climate Resilience**: to address existential threats of climate change especially rising sea levels and cope with rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns to sustain a liveable environment. 

**Economic Resilience**: to ensure the future Singapore economy remains competitive by overcoming carbon & resource constraints, and to rally stakeholders towards sustainable economic growth.

**Resource Resilience**: to ensure safe and secure supply of critical resources, i.e. water and food, and to overcome global resource constraints by maximising resource efficiency & closing our resource loops. 

Our priorities are to:
* Move Towards a Zero Waste Nation and Circular Economy
* Build a Smart, Resilient and Sustainable Water System
* Strengthen our Climate Change Resilience and Transition to a Low-Carbon Future
* Achieve Food Safety and Security Sustainably
* Build a Liveable and Endearing Home
