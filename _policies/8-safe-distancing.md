# Safe Distancing for COVID-19

Under Phase 2 of our re-opening, all members of public are required to adhere to safe distancing measures, as announced earlier by the Ministry of Health. These measures include:

a) Wearing of face masks at all times when outside one’s home, unless when eating, drinking or doing strenuous exercises

b) Maintaining a safe distance of at least one metre between individuals

c) Maintaining a safe distance of at least one metre between groups (each group is to comprise not more than five persons) and strictly no intermingling between groups.

d) At home, there should not be more than five visitors at any one time.

Safe Distancing Ambassadors (SDA) and Safe Distancing Enforcement Officers (EO) will continue to be on the ground to remind members of public of these measures. We urge members of the public to cooperate with the SDAs and EOs when approached.

**It’s a collective effort – play your part**

Even as we expand our testing strategy and improve contact tracing efforts, it is important that everyone plays their part in our country’s safe re-opening.

- Do download the TraceTogether App, and use SafeEntry when entering premises, to help with contact tracing.
- You may wish to refer to [www.spaceout.gov.sg](http://www.spaceout.gov.sg/) to check the crowd situation before heading to the markets, supermarkets, malls, sports facilities and Sentosa.
- When visiting the parks, do check [https://SafeDistParks.nparks.gov.sg](https://safedistparks.nparks.gov.sg/) for the latest updates on visitorship levels.

**Remember – you are the first line of defence**

It is important to practise safe distancing and maintain good personal hygiene as we go about our daily lives, so that we can reduce the risks of transmission in the community.

- If you are sick, see a doctor and stay at home.

- Wash your hands with soap frequently or use hand sanitiser.

- Avoid sharing food or shaking hands.

- Dispose used tissues and masks into trash bins.

- When dining out, return trays and used crockery after meals to keep tables clean for others.

- Use contactless payment where possible

  

Our collective efforts will keep Singapore safe, and allow for the gradual resumption of more activities.
