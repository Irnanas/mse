<h1><b>Research & Innovation</b></h1>
<p>Research & Innovation has been a key enabler for Singapore to overcome our natural constraints. The Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE), together with our statutory boards - the National Environment Agency (NEA), PUB, Singapore’s National Water Agency, and the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) - will continue to invest in Research & Development and build Science & Technology capabilities in Singapore to address complex challenges such as climate change, environmental sustainability, water and food security.</p>
<p>We invite interested private sector and research partners to join us on this journey, working closely together to co-develop innovative solutions and technologies to address these complex, cross-cutting challenges.</p>

		<p>The <a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/programmes-grants/grants-and-awards/closing-the-waste-loop-initiative">Closing the Waste Loop Initiative (CTWL) R&D programme</a> is a $45 million programme under RIE2020 that supports R&D projects which address the challenges posed by increasing waste generation, scarcity of resources and land constraint for waste management. The main objectives are to promote R&D that are resource efficient, maintain high standards of public health, as well as contribute to meeting the target in the Zero Waste Masterplan to achieve an overall reduction of waste to landfill by 30% by 2030, and enable Singapore to become a Zero Waste Nation.</p>
		<p>The <a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/programmes-grants/grants-and-awards/wte-testbed-demo-initiative">WtE programme</a> aims to enhance energy and resource recovery from Singapore’s municipal solid waste by building up Singapore’s research capabilities in these areas, and establishing a WtE research facility to provide a platform to enable the transition of research outcomes to commercial application and deployment. The programme targets to increase the electrical efficiency of Singapore’s WtE processes from about 23% currently to 27% post 2020 and 30% post 2030.</p>

These funding support include the Productivity Solutions Grant (PSG) administered by NEA and financial assistance from Enterprise Singapore (ESG).</p>
		<p>The National Innovation Challenges are periodic open innovation calls to academia and industry to work together with government agencies to develop practical, impactful solutions to large and complex problems facing Singapore. By bringing together industry partners, government agencies, and innovators to work on the identified challenges, these calls seek to harness Singapore’s vast research and innovation capabilities to develop innovative technological solutions to sustain our long-term growth and resilience. NEA and Enterprise Singapore (ESG) have jointly launched <a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/industry-transformation-map/innovation-calls-and-request-for-proposals">innovation calls and request for proposals</a> for industry solutions as part of the NIC.</p>
		<p>A <a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/industry-transformation-map/regulatory-sandbox">regulatory sandbox</a> under the Environmental Services Industry Transformation Map (ES ITM) has been established by NEA to create an environment for experimentation where regulations can be relaxed within parameters, to promote innovation in Singapore’s environmental services industry. It also allows the regulator to assess the impact of the new technology/solution before deciding on the appropriate regulatory adjustments. Interested parties can apply to enter the Sandbox to experiment innovative environmental services related technologies and solutions in a controlled environment within a fixed duration, without compromising environmental, public health and safety aspects.</p>
		<p>Under the Innovating and Curating Better Automation and Technologies for Environmental Services (INCUBATE) Programme, NEA has partnered with technology and service providers as well as premise owners to collaborate on ways to address challenges they face in the area of environmental services, including the conduct of trials for technologies and innovations and sharing the results and learning of such trials.</p>
