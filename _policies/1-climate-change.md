<h1><b>Our Climate Policy in a Nutshell</b></h1>

<p><strong>GAME CHANGING CLIMATE CHANGE</strong><br>  Climate change is an existential challenge for Singapore. Our actions to mitigate and adapt to climate change form part of our national sustainability effort. We aim to increase understanding of the science and impacts of climate change, to guide the planning and implementation of measures to safeguard Singapore against the impacts of climate change.</p>
<p><strong>COOPERATING WITH INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS</strong><br>  Climate change is a global challenge. Singapore will do our part to tackle climate change and facilitate international cooperation on dealing with climate change.</p>
<p><strong>EDUCATING SINGAPOREANS ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE</strong><br>  The negative effects of climate change take time to manifest. However, awareness and action must begin now. We encourage stakeholders in Singapore to learn about climate change and how they can play their part to mitigate it.</p>

<h2 id="our-main-plans">Our Main Plans</h2>
<div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title1"  /><label for="title1">Understanding The Science Of Weather And Climate</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Singapore will invest into research on the science and impacts of climate change, especially in the region around Singapore.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title2"  /><label for="title2">Adapting To The Impacts Of Climate Change</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Climate change will threaten our access to essential resources such as water and food. As a low-lying city state, we are also vulnerable to rising sea levels and weather variabilities. Even as we reduce our carbon emissions, Singapore must also adapt against the impacts of climate change. We need to invest in resilient infrastructure to safeguard our people and our future.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title3"  /><label for="title3">Carbon Pricing</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>We need to discourage the emission of greenhouse gases, which contribute to climate change. We have therefore implemented a carbon tax on greenhouse gas emissions. The revenue from this carbon tax is used to fund further measures to reduce carbon emissions.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title4"  /><label for="title4">Cooperating With International Partners</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>We have made pledges under the Paris Agreement, and updated our Nationally Determined Contribution and Long-Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy. We co-facilitated negotiations on climate mitigation measures at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of the Parties, and hosted the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Scoping Meeting for the Sixth Assessment Cycle (AR6) Synthesis Report in 2019. We also contribute to global efforts led by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and International Maritime Organisation (IMO) to address emissions from the aviation and maritime sectors.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title5"  /><label for="title5">Educating Singaporeans About Climate Mitigation</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>We communicate the implications of climate change to stakeholders from the various sectors and encourage them to take steps to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions. We do this through various campaigns; for instance, we designated 2018 as the Year of Climate Action.</p>

<h2>Understanding Climate Change</h2>
<div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title6"  /><label for="title6">The Issue</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>The build-up of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere has trapped more heat - resulting in a warmer planet. Temperatures on Earth have been rising at about 0.13°C per decade over the past 50 years.</p>
		<p>A warmer climate leads to the thermal expansion of the sea and melting of glaciers and ice caps, which lead to rising sea levels, threatening our island nation. There may be more frequent extreme weather events, which threaten our water and food supply. Along with the rest of the world, Singapore experiences the effects of climate change.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title7"  /><label for="title7">The Challenge</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Much research has been done on the impacts of climate change on the global scale, but different regions may be impacted differently by climate change. More research needs to contextualise to Singapore and our surrounding regions to inform our adaptation plans.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title8"  /><label for="title8">Our Efforts</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>The Centre for Climate Research Singapore (CCRS)  was established under the Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS) in 2013 and today is one of the few dedicated tropical climate research centres and key node for climate and weather research in Singapore. CCRS runs high-resolution regional climate models to produce long-term projections of rainfall, temperature, wind and sea level in Singapore. CCRS has just embarked on the Third National Climate Change Study to provide an update of the projections.</p>

<a id="carbon-pricing"></a>

<h2>Carbon Pricing</h2>
<div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title9"  /><label for="title9">The Issue</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Carbon emissions make up 97% of our total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These emissions cause more heat to be trapped into the atmosphere, leading to climate change. We need to create incentives to reduce carbon emissions, and one of these incentives is a carbon tax.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title10"  /><label for="title10">Our Efforts</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Singapore introduced a carbon tax in 2019, as part of the Carbon Pricing Act. The carbon tax will put in place a uniform and economy-wide price signal to incentivise emitters to reduce their emissions, while giving them the flexibility to act in the most economically efficient way.</p>
		<p>The tax will be applied on facilities that emit more than 25,000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO<sub>2</sub>e) of emissions annually, and cover seven greenhouse gases (GHGs). To give the industry more time to adjust and implement energy efficiency projects, the tax will start at $5/tCO<sub>2</sub>e from 2019 to 2023. The Government will review the tax rate by 2023. We intend to increase the tax to between $10-$15/ tCO<sub>2</sub>e by 2030. In doing so, we will consider international climate change developments, the progress of our emissions mitigation efforts, and our economic competitiveness.</p>
		<p>The first payment of the carbon tax will be in 2020, based on emissions in calendar year 2019. The impact on households and most businesses will be small, leading to an increase of around 1% in electricity prices. An additional $20 in the annual U-Save Rebates will be provided to all eligible HDB households over a period of 3 years, starting from 2019, to offset the expected increase in utilities expenses.</p>
		<p>In addition to taxing greenhouse gas emissions, the Carbon Pricing Act also imposes obligations on large GHG emitters to measure, report and verify their emissions.</p>

<h2>Protecting Against Sea Level Rise</h2>
<div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title11"  /><label for="title11">The Issue</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Singapore is fundamentally vulnerable to the impact of climate change, particularly the threat of rising sea levels, with 30% of our island less than 5 metre above sea level. Based on CCRS’s Second National Climate Change Study completed in 2015, we could experience a mean sea level rise by up to about 1 metre by the end of the century.</p>
	</div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="title12"  /><label for="title12">Our Efforts</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Since April 2020, PUB, Singapore’s National Water Agency, has taken on the role of the national Coastal Protection Agency. By combining coastal protection responsibilities with its stormwater management functions, PUB will look at inland and coastal flooding holistically to strengthen Singapore’s resilience against climate change.</p>
		<p>The Coastal Adaptation Study (CAS) was commissioned by the Building & Construction Authority (BCA) to better understand the potential impacts of sea level rise. This study was completed in 2019 and has helped prioritise coastal protection plans at vulnerable areas. PUB will embark on site-specific engineering studies, and studies and work closely with other agencies and stakeholders to develop long-term strategies and engineering designs for coastal protection measures. The first of these studies, beginning with City-East Coast and Jurong Island, are due to commence from 2020 onwards.</p>
