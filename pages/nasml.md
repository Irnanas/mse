<h2><b>Marine Litter</b></h2>
<div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="p1-1"  /><label for="p1-1">A Global Problem</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p><span>Marine litter, sometimes referred to as marine debris, is defined as &ldquo;any persistent, manufactured, or processed solid material that is discarded, disposed of or abandoned in the marine and coastal environment.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:107%;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>[1]</span></span></span></a> It comes in many forms and includes plastic bags, glass, wood and tyres. Marine litter comes from many sources, and is moved across the oceans by prevailing winds and tides. Globally, 80% of marine litter comes from land-based sources, particularly landfills, rivers and floodwaters, industrial outfalls, discharge from storm water drains, untreated municipal sewerage, and littering of beaches and coastal areas.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:107%;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>[2]</span></span></span></a> Rapidly increasing levels of marine litter, including plastic litter and microplastics, are a serious environmental problem on a global scale. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Plastics are considered the most persistent and problematic of the different types of marine litter.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:107%;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>[3]</span></span></span></a> More than 150 million tonnes of plastic are estimated to have been dumped in the world&rsquo;s oceans, with about 8 million tonnes added every year. The duration required for these plastics to biodegrade completely is in the hundreds of years. The buoyant characteristic of plastic litter, combined with its slow biodegrading nature, leads to tremendous dispersal potential in our oceans.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In addition, larger plastic objects when weathered and fragmented become microplastics, operationally defined as small particles or fragments measuring less than 5 millimetres in diameter.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:107%;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>[4]</span></span></span></a> These microplastics are easily ingested by marine creatures and can potentially cause harm to human and environmental health.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:107%;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>[5]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Marine litter poses environmental, economic, health, cultural and aesthetic threats, including the loss of biodiversity and degradation of marine and coastal habitats and ecosystems. Marine wildlife such as whales, turtles, seabirds, and crustaceans are especially vulnerable to plastic marine litter as it disrupts their digestion and causes physical lacerations and entanglement. Floating plastics contribute to the spread of invasive organisms that can disrupt ecosystems. Marine plastic litter can leach chemicals used in its production and pose a threat to human health. Litter on coasts also affects the aesthetic value of tourist destinations leading to decreased tourism-related income, and major financial costs related to the cleaning and maintaining of coasts. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Marine litter is also a transboundary issue. It is transported across seas through ocean currents and waves. One example is the Great Pacific Garbage Patch of marine litter from around the world. A 2011 United Nations Environment Programme Report stated that marine litter has been found even in the most remote places on Earth with few or no humans present, such as on St Brandon&rsquo;s Islands in the Indian Ocean.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:107%;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>[6]</span></span></span></a> In Singapore, we have also seen increased landings of marine litter on our shores during the monsoon season. It is thus imperative that the issue of marine litter is addressed through collective and coordinated action on a national, regional, and global level, in line with Target 14.1 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:107%;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>[7]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As a responsible global citizen, Singapore recognises our role in contributing to the collective response to tackling marine litter and microplastics. This National Action Strategy aims to summarise and outline Singapore&rsquo;s various actions and measures to combat the issue of marine litter.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2><b>Singapore’s Context</b></h2>

<div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="p2-1"/><label for="p2-1">Marine and Coastal Landscape</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p><span>Singapore is a small and heavily urbanised island-state in Southeast Asia situated at the southern tip of the Malayan Peninsula between Malaysia and Indonesia. Located between the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea, Singapore is bordered on the north by the narrow Johor Strait, which separates it from Peninsular Malaysia, and on the south by the Singapore Strait (Figure 1). The Johor Strait is divided into East and West Johor Straits by the Singapore-Malaysia causeway. The Strait receives water mainly from Sungai Johor and Sungai Pulai, both located in Malaysia.&nbsp;</span></p>

	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p><span>The challenge of marine litter is a multifaceted one, and each country has its own unique circumstances. Any approach to reduce marine litter must be tailored specifically to the needs of the country and local geographies, with no &lsquo;one size fits all&rsquo; solution. Furthermore, the complexity of the marine litter challenge means that a whole of nation approach is needed, to ensure we can tackle the issue holistically. This includes working closely with stakeholders from various sectors to understand the issue and develop solutions together, and to bring about the enduring and sustainable changes needed to reduce and prevent marine litter. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As the largest quantity of marine litter entering oceans in the region stems from land-based sources, it is imperative to place focus on waste reduction and waste management. Singapore is committed to addressing both land-based and sea-based sources of marine litter through the measures outlined in this National Action Strategy, which is guided by the core principles of sustainable development and a circular economy approach, and supports the achievement of global goals, such as SDG 14.1. The priority areas for the National Action Strategy are as follows:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;margin-left:44px;">
    <li>Reduction of Land-Based Sources of Litter</li>
    <li>Reduction of Sea-Based Sources of Litter</li>
    <li>Circular Economy Approach</li>
    <li>Research &amp; Development</li>
    <li>Maintaining and Strengthening Outreach &amp; Stakeholder Engagement</li>
    <li>International Engagement and Collaboration</li>
</ol>
<p><span>The National Action Strategy will undergo regular reviews. This will ensure that Singapore adapts quickly to new circumstances and opportunities, in line with the collective global, regional and national imperatives. The following section broadly outlines the various policy actions which seek to address the issue of marine litter both internationally and domestically.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2><b>Priority Areas and Measures</b></h2>

<div>
	<input type="checkbox" id="p4-1"  /><label for="p4-1">Reduction of Land-Based Sources of Litter</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Globally, land-based waste is the largest source of marine litter. To minimise the waste at source and prevent discharge of litter into the sea, countries need to prevent and reduce land-based sources of marine pollution through stringent regulations on pollution control and waste management. Countries also need to have in place a comprehensive waste and water management system to prevent any leakage of such waste into the seas and ocean. 
In Singapore, we have minimised marine litter from land-based sources in the following ways:</p>
		<p><ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman">
		<li><b>Control of waste collection and disposal</b><br>
<p>Through the Environmental Public Health Act (EPHA), NEA ensures there is a comprehensive and integrated waste collection and management system in Singapore. All waste from municipal, commercial and industrial sources in Singapore are collected for disposal or recycling. NEA also controls the discharge of trade effluent, oil, chemical, sewage or other polluting matters into drains, as well as hazardous substances into inland waters. The EPHA also includes strict anti-littering regulations.</p><br></li>
		<li><b>Integrated solid waste management system</b><br>
		<p>All incinerable wastes including plastics that are not segregated at source for recycling are collected and disposed of at waste-to-energy (WTE) plants. These WTE plants are fitted with modern air pollution control systems such as flue gas treatment systems to ensure that flue gases are treated to meet local air emission standards. Ash from the WTE process, together with other non-incinerable wastes, are disposed of at the off-shore sanitary Semakau Landfill.<a href="#ftnp4-1-1" name="_ftnp4-1-1" title=""><sup><sup><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:107%;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>[1]</span></sup></sup></a> This integrated solid waste management system ensures the proper collection and treatment of all solid wastes, and prevents waste, such as plastic, from entering the ocean</p><br>
		</li>
		<li><b>Treatment of all wastewater before discharge to sea</b><br>
		<p>PUB, Singapore’s National Water Agency, ensures all used water is collected and treated at water reclamation plants (WRPs) to internationally recognised discharge standards. During the treatment process, microplastics, which includes microbeads, are removed as sludge and incinerated. PUB is planning to extend the use of membrane bioreactor technology (MBR) systems at its WRPs to enhance its water treatment process, which would further reduce the discharge of microplastics into the sea.</p><br></li>
		<li><b>Waterway and coastal clean-up</b><br>
		<p>Singapore has a range of waterway clean-up measures that ensure that litter or plastic waste, regardless of source, that might otherwise wash into the ocean is prevented from doing so. Litter that enters our waterways is caught by litter traps installed at appropriate locations and expediently removed by flotsam removal craft. In addition, marine litter that washes onto our recreational beaches and coastlines are removed by NEA and other government agencies, regardless of litter sources. NEA also cleans the recreational beaches and coastlines under its purview regularly with frequencies ranging from four times a week to once in two weeks, depending on public usage and accessibility to the beach. In 2020, NEA collected over 1,300 tonnes of flotsam from the beach at East Coast Park, of which about 58% were collected during the Southwest monsoon months. During those months, the amount of flotsam collected from the beach is around 2.7 times more than the non-monsoon period.  In total, NEA collected 3,485.7 tonnes of marine litter from the recreational beaches and coastlines that it cleaned.<br>
		Community groups play a significant role in Singapore’s efforts to clean up our waterways and coasts. Ground community groups frequently organise initiatives and clean-up activities around Singapore to contribute to the keeping the nation clean, raise awareness on the global marine litter problem, and to encourage the public to adopt more sustainable practices. More information on community initiatives can be found in <a href="#p6">Annexes</a>.</p><br></li>
		<li><b>Regulating general waste disposal facilities</b><br>
		<p>NEA regulates general waste disposal facilities through the EPHA, the Environmental Public Health (General Waste Disposal Facility) Regulation 2017 and the Environmental Public Health (General Waste Disposal Facility – Exemption) Regulations 2019. Licensees must ensure that their maintenance and operations of their licenced GWDF premises do not endanger public health and the environment.</p></li>

	<input type="checkbox" id="p4-2"  /><label for="p4-2">Reduction of Sea-Based Sources of Litter</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p><span>While land-based waste is the biggest source of marine litter, an estimated 20% of marine litter can be linked to various ocean-based sources.<a href="#ftnp4-2-1" name="_ftnp4-2-1" title=""><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:107%;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;color:black;'>[1]</span></span></span></a> As a major transhipment hub, Singapore is committed to the managing sea-based sources of waste through the prevention of pollution from ships. For shipping, Singapore was among the first countries in Asia to ratify all six Annexes of the International Maritime Organization&rsquo;s (IMO) International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL), the main international convention covering prevention of pollution of the marine environment by ships. The following actions are carried out by Singapore with the aim to reduce sea-based sources of marine litter:</span></p>
		<p><ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman">
		<li><b>Inspections on ships</b><br>
		<p>As a responsible flag state and port state, Singapore conducts inspections on both Singapore-registered ships and foreign-registered ships in our port to ensure that they comply with regulations on garbage disposal into the sea and that anti-pollution measures are in place. Ships are also required to maintain garbage record and management plans for verification by inspectors. The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) patrols port waters to ensure that ships in the Port of Singapore do not discharge waste, oil, garbage, or sewage into the sea.</p><br></li>
		<li><b>Offshore fish farms</b><br>
		<p>Offshore fish farms are prohibited from dumping waste into the sea and routine farm inspections are carried out to ensure compliance.  Enforcement action is taken against farms contravening the Fisheries (Fish Culture Farms) Rules under the Fisheries Act. Those found guilty of an offence are liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or both. Offshore fish farms are required to dispose their waste at bins located at Lim Chu Kang and Lorong Halus jetties, which are emptied daily by refuse trucks for incineration.</p><br></li>
		<li><b>Cleaning of coastal waters</b><br>
		<p>MPA deploys nine crafts on a daily basis to remove flotsam from the sea to ensure safe navigation of vessels. The cleaning efforts are stepped up during the monsoon seasons by deploying these crafts according to the prevailing monsoon. Dive clean-ups are also organised by community groups contributing to the national effort to keep our coastal waters clean.</p><br></li>
		<li><b>Implementation of MARPOL</b><br>
		<p>In Singapore, MARPOL is implemented under the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea Act (PPSA) and its subsidiary legislation. MARPOL Annex V is implemented under the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea (Garbage) Regulations 2012 which provides for fines of up to $20,000, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both, for offences committed.  The Prevention of Pollution of the Sea (Garbage) Regulations 2012 apply to (i) Singapore-registered ships wherever they may be; and (ii) foreign-registered ships in Singapore waters. As part of our MARPOL obligations, the MPA deploys five garbage collection crafts daily at scheduled timings to collect garbage from ships at the anchorages. Bins are also provided at piers for harbour operators to dispose their waste as littering and waste disposal at sea is prohibited.</p></li>

	<input type="checkbox" id="p4-3"  /><label for="p4-3">Circular Economy Approach</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>While we minimise marine litter from entering the ocean, we also look to address waste at its source. Singapore does so by adopting a circular economy approach to waste and resource management which targets our key waste streams. Through this, we hope to prevent the general production of waste products, which if improperly disposed of, may find their way into the sea. To this end, we launched the Zero Waste Masterplan in 2019, which outlines Singapore’s key strategies to reuse and recycle resources, turn trash into treasure, and produce and consume sustainably. Under the Masterplan, Singapore carries out the following measures that seek to close the waste loop through a circular economy approach. </p>
		<p><ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman">
		<li><b>Reducing the use of disposables</b><br>
		<p>NEA launched the “Say YES to Waste Less” campaign in 2019 to encourage the public to reduce food wastage and use of disposables. As part of the campaign, waste reduction measures are emphasised, such as bringing reusable food containers, bottles and bags for takeaway and opting to go without disposable cutlery. NEA has also been encouraging the use of reusable cutlery and crockery in our hawker centres. For newer hawker centres, NEA has disallowed the use of disposables for dine-in meals from the start of the hawker centre’ operations. Since September 2018, disposables are also no longer permitted for dine-in when new cooked food stallholders start to operate at existing NEA-managed centres.</p><br></li>
		<li><b>Promoting recycling</b><br>
		<p><span>Overall, 3 in 5 Singaporean households recycle regularly.<a href="#ftnp4-3-1" name="_ftnp4-3-1" title=""><sup><sup><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:107%;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>[1]</span></sup></sup></a> To increase household recycling rates, Singapore has implemented the National Recycling Programme since 2001.&nbsp;</span>Public waste collectors are required to provide recycling bins and recyclable collection services to all Housing Development Board (HDB) apartment blocks, opt-in condominiums, and landed property premises for Singaporeans to recycle items including plastic easily, thus reducing the amount sent to Singapore&rsquo;s WTE plants for incineration and, consequentially, ash disposal at the Semakau Landfill. Since 2019, NEA has been actively engaging the public through the #RecycleRight campaign, which aims to encourage Singaporeans to recycle more and recycle right. These messages were reinforced at community events, on social media, through notices on HDB apartment lift doors and posters on noticeboards. NEA refreshes the labels on all recycling bins/chutes from time to time to improve the presentation of information on recycling, to help more households identify the right items to recycle.</p>
<p><span>Information on the recycling processes for recyclables collected from households is published on <a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/waste-management/3r-programmes-and-resources/types-of-recyclables-and-recycling-processes">NEA&rsquo;s website</a>. To further highlight the importance of recycling and reducing waste sent to landfill, the lifespan of Semakau Landfill is updated annually through MSE&rsquo;s Key Environmental Statistics publication.</span></p>
<p><span>To assist companies in assessing their current waste management practices, and identifying opportunities to reduce, reuse and recycle waste materials to reduce waste disposal needs, NEA has published 3R Guidebooks for premises such as hotels, shopping malls, offices and industrial developments.&nbsp;</span></p><br></li>
		<li><b>Legislations</b><br>
		<p>Singapore implemented the landmark Resource Sustainability Act (RSA) in 2019, which provides the legislative framework to impose upstream regulatory measures to address our priority waste streams – e-waste, food waste, packaging waste including plastics. The RSA marks a paradigm shift in our approach to waste management – while efficient waste disposal is necessary, our goal is first and foremost to reduce, reuse and recycle. Regulations under the RSA include the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) Framework for e-waste, a Mandatory Packaging Reporting framework, and mandatory segregation and treatment requirements for food waste. We will also introduce the legislative framework for the beverage containers return scheme by 2022, before the implementation of the scheme in 2023 as the first phase of the EPR for packaging waste.</p></li>

		<p>A robust, science-based approach drives Singapore&rsquo;s National Action Strategy and its supporting policies. To this end, we work in close partnership with academia and industry, to deepen our understanding of the marine litter challenge, and co-create solutions and promote circularity to address and reduce marine litter.<br><br>
In the first research of its kind in the region done by Ng and Obbard, Singapore&rsquo;s coastal region has particles of polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, nylon, polyvinyl alcohol and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, in seawater and sediment particles.<a href="#ftnp4-4-1" name="_ftnp4-4-1" title=""><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:115%;"><span style="vertical-align:super;"><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:107%;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>[1]</span></span></span></span></a> They considered these microplastics to be most likely derived from broken down larger debris, especially the samples from public beaches where end-user plastic litter is common. Today, Singapore continues to conduct research on projects (through the Urban Solutions and Sustainability (USS) domain of the national Research, Innovation, and Enterprise (RIE) 2025 Strategy), activities and measures such as monitoring programmes and preventive technology. Through these research efforts, we hope to promote knowledge sharing, such as between experts, and to deliver long-term solutions that will strengthen institutional and human capacities to address the issue of marine litter.</p>
		<p><ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman">
		<li><b>Membrane bioreactor technology (MBR) systems at water reclamation plants</b><br>
		<p>Research and Development into MBR technology and other water treatment technologies under the water research domain in RIE2025 USS, aims to improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of water reclamation efforts in Singapore. During the treatment process, microplastics, which includes microbeads, are substantially removed as sludge and subsequently incinerated. An extension of these MBR systems is planned to further reduce the amount of microplastics discharged into the sea.</p><br>
		</li>
		<li><b>NUS-NParks Marine Debris Study</b><br>
		<p>NParks collaborated with the National University of Singapore (NUS) on a research project on marine debris in Singapore. The study, which started in 2016 and concluded in 2020, sought to establish baseline data on marine debris on Singapore's shores, develop a citizen science programme to monitor macro-debris and micro-debris (specifically microplastics), and facilitate dialogue with stakeholders to formulate policy recommendations. The study found that the most common macro-debris are styrofoam pieces, hard plastic fragments, film plastic pieces, food wrappers and straws, whereas the common types of micro-debris are styrofoam, film, hard plastic fragments and pellets. During the study, higher macro-debris trash volumes were observed at the northern recreational beaches of Changi Beach, Pasir Ris, Punggol, Coney Island and Sembawang during the Northeast Monsoon (December to early March), and southern coasts, such as East Coast Park, during the Southwest Monsoon (June to September), indicating that Singapore’s marine litter were brought in by natural tidal conditions observed through the monsoons. It was observed that there was no seasonality influence for micro-debris. To build on current knowledge of the marine litter situation in Singapore, and in coordination with the NUS-NParks Marine Debris Study, NEA has embarked on a Marine Litter and Microplastics Consultancy Study, to provide a better understanding of the levels and pathways of marine litter and microplastics in Singapore’s inland waterways, coastal waters, and recreational beaches. Data and methods used in both studies will be incorporated into a future national monitoring programme where appropriate.</p><br></li>
		<li><b>Use of technology</b><br>
		<p>Singapore continues to explore the use of technology in developing solutions to address marine litter effectively and efficiently. Six seabins were installed at the Marine Barrage Jetty to remove flotsam in the area which is not easily accessible by boat. For beach cleaning, the Beach Bobcat and Robocut Beach Cleaning Machine are used to increase cleaning efficiency. For coastal waters, MPA awarded the MINT (Maritime Innovation and Technology) Product Development fund in 2019 to ST Engineering for the development of an autonomous flotsam clearance vessel, to improve the coastal flotsam clearance process. The project concluded in 2021 with a proof-of-concept involving the fabrication, testing and demonstration of a prototype vessel to conduct automatic flotsam clearance at Woodlands Jetty. MPA is currently exploring the deployment of these autonomous flotsam clearance vessels for further field testing in real world conditions by 2023. Below is a box story on some of the technology used by Singapore to prevent and manage marine litter.</p></li>

	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>As an island-state with a well-endowed coastal and marine environment, Singapore is cognisant of the impact of marine litter on the environment and society. As the issue of marine litter is also connected to individual behavioural patterns related to production, consumption, waste disposal, and littering, Singapore seeks to pursue continued engagement with various stakeholders, such as civil society organisations (CSOs), industry experts, and academic/technical experts, in developing solutions to tackle marine litter. By galvanising community efforts, and promoting coordination and cooperation, we aim to invigorate and support the People-Private-Public (3P) sector in co-creating integrated waste management and wastewater treatment solutions that help to reduce marine litter. (see Annex A for examples).</p>
		<p><ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman">
		<li><b>People, Private and Public (3P) Partnerships</b><br>
		<p>3P sectors come up with initiatives to reduce the generation of land-based solid waste, including plastic waste. For example, retailers such as Starbucks and IKEA encourage consumers to bring their own reusables  by either charging for single-use plastic bags, incentivising the use of reusables or by not making them available.</p><br>
		</li>
		<li><b>Raising Awareness through Collaboration with Ground-Up Initiatives</b><br>
		<p>Environmental groups such as Zero Waste SG, Public Hygiene Council (PHC) and Waterways Watch Society (WWS) foster shared ownership in keeping the environment clean and minimising waste. These groups play an important role in raising awareness and getting the public to take action to keep our land and watercourses clean. Non-profit groups have also organised maritime environmental outreach programmes to raise public awareness on the importance of protecting the marine environment and biodiversity among members of the public, through talks on marine conservation, underwater clean-up, and litter-picking activities on our water surface and on our shores.</p><br></li>
		<li><b>Engaging Citizens to co-create solutions</b><br>
		<p>Under the Zero Waste Masterplan, several Citizens Workgroups have been organised to engage citizens to co-create solutions. A Workgroup on Recycling Right was convened in 2019 co-create solutions to improve household recycling. The redesign of the recycling bins was one of the recommendations proposed by the members which involved a transparent bin with clear messaging. MSE and NEA are undertaking a pilot project on the use of the transparent recycling bins in November 2021.  Another recommendation from the workgroup was the National Deposit and Return Scheme for beverage containers (i.e. beverage containers return scheme), which will be implemented in 2023 and be part of the efforts to increase Singapore’s recycling rate to 70% as part of the Zero Waste Masterplan. <br>
			A Citizens’ Workgroup on Reducing the Excessive Consumption of Disposables was also convened in 2020 to co-create recommendations to address the excessive use of disposables, including single-use plastics. Eight recommendations from the workgroup were supported, including recommendations to impose a charge for carrier bags at supermarkets to reduce the use of such bags, and the use of nudges to encourage behavioural change.</p><br></li>
		<li><b>Community initiatives</b><br>
		<p>Community initiatives have played a significant role in raising awareness and supporting action to address marine litter and promote sustainability in Singapore. These ground-up groups have spurred public participation and discussions to ignite a change in the mindsets and behaviours of Singaporeans. A range of initiatives are frequently organised across the island targeting different sections of the community to engage the public on environmentally sustainable practices and to clean-up waterways, beaches and coastal waters (Annex A). In 2021, feedback was sought from citizens through such groups  to provide feedback on the development of this National Action Strategy and recommendations to improve the marine litter situation on Singapore’s coasts.</p><br>
		</li>
		<li><b>Educating youths</b><br>
		<p>Lessons with elements of sustainability have been incorporated into the national school curriculum for youths. These aim to instil a sustainability mindset and educate youths to understand the impact of their actions on the environment, and to inculcate the values of care, respect, and responsibility for the environment. Using real-world examples and case studies, youths are engaged in learning about pollution-related issues in the sciences and humanities with marine litter often cited as an example.</p>

		<p>Given the transboundary nature of marine litter, Singapore contributes actively to regional and international efforts to coordinate action and work towards a collective approach to raise awareness and tackle the global problem of marine litter pollution.</p>
		<p><ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman">
		<li><b>International and Regional Platforms</b><br>
		Internationally, Singapore has been an active participant in initiatives on marine litter. For example, Singapore participated in the United Nations Environment Programme’s (UNEP) work on marine litter and microplastics, including at the Ad-Hoc Open-Ended Expert Group (AHEG) on Marine Litter and Microplastics, which seeks to follow-up on the UNEA Resolutions 4/6 and 4/9 on Marine Plastic Litter and on Addressing Single-Use Plastic Products Pollution. Singapore is also involved in ongoing discussions under UNEP to establish an intergovernmental negotiations committee for a global agreement on marine plastic pollution. Singapore also participated in the G20’s work under the Japanese G20 Presidency to establish the 2019 G20 Implementation Framework for Actions on Marine Plastic Litter. These platforms have allowed Singapore to contribute to global efforts to address marine litter and play a part in developing international best practices and guidelines to address marine litter. <br><br>
		Regionally, Singapore, alongside other ASEAN member states, adopted the Bangkok Declaration on Combating Marine Debris and the ASEAN Framework of Action on Marine Debris, to protect the marine environment and strengthen regional cooperation on marine debris issues at the 34th ASEAN Summit in June 2019. As a follow-up to the Framework of Action, Singapore worked with ASEAN Member States to develop an ASEAN Regional Action Plan on Combating Marine Debris (RAP). The RAP was endorsed and adopted by the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on the Environment (AMME) in May 2021. Singapore is also active in marine litter initiatives organized by the Coordinating Body on the Seas of East Asia (COBSEA) and Partnerships in Environmental Management of the Seas of East Asia (PEMSEA).  Singapore’s participation at these regional platforms has also allowed us coordinate efforts with our neighbours and address marine litter collectively as a region. <br><br>

		<li><b>Development Cooperation</b><br>
		<p>Singapore conducts capacity building programmes under the Singapore Cooperation Programme (SCP) to support other developing countries in combatting marine litter.

		<p>Singapore currently has a suite of comprehensive, science-based measures to address the issue of marine litter. Further studies are being carried out to build upon our existing knowledge base to help us deepen our understanding of the scope and scale of marine litter, specific to Singapore’s context. This will enable us to further sharpen our efforts and put in place more targeted measures, particularly with regard to the movement or pathways of marine litter and their effects on the ecosystem.<br><br>
Addressing marine litter requires national action. The Government works in partnership with our communities and stakeholders, to put in place enduring solutions to tackle this challenge. This National Action Strategy on Marine Litter seeks to galvanise and invigorate further efforts from all sectors of society, which will be critical in bring about lasting change. Through this whole of nation approach, we hope to ensure Singaporeans, for generations to come, can continue to enjoy the coastal and marine environment that surrounds our island home.
