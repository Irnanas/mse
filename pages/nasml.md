<h1><b>Addressing Marine Litter in Singapore</b></h1>

Marine litter comes in many forms and includes plastic bags, glass, wood and tyres. It can come from many sources too, and is moved across the oceans by prevailing winds and tides.

Marine litter poses environmental, economic, health, cultural and aesthetic threats, including the loss of biodiversity and degradation of marine and coastal habitats and ecosystems.

As a responsible global citizen, Singapore recognises our role in contributing to the collective response to tackling marine litter and microplastics. 

This is why Singapore has released its first National Action Strategy on Marine Litter, which outlines comprehensive measures across six priority areas to tackle marine litter.
