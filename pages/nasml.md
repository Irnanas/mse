    <td>Citizens’ Workgroup On Reducing Excessive Consumption of Disposables (RD CWG)</td>
    <td>The RD CWG was convened in 2020 to co-create recommendations to reduce the excessive use of disposables, including single-use plastics. The RD CWG brought together a diverse group of workgroup members from different backgrounds, professions, and demography to   develop a better understanding of the perspectives and concerns of different segments of the population regarding the use of disposables. Through the process of learning and co-solutioning with relevant stakeholders, the workgroup members developed and finetuned their ideas, and submitted 14 recommendations to MSE and NEA in relation to reducing the excessive consumption of disposables such as carrier bags, food containers, cutlery, and packaging. MSE and NEA supported eight recommendations and would also be  working with the People, Private and Public (3P) sectors to co-deliver six other recommendations.      </td>

In 2018, 20,915 cigarette butts   were collected during the International Coastal Cleanup in Singapore, with the highest number of cigarette butts found at beaches in  East Coast and Changi. The programme also aims to improve education and outreach efforts about the marine environment.    </td>

The voluntary guideline will consist of a checklist of sustainable practices that F&amp;B establishments can adopt to reduce their use of disposables. It will be circulated to NEA’s network of F&amp;B partners and made available on NEA’s website for download. Part of the checklist may also be incorporated into the evaluation criteria of the Singapore Environment Council’s Eco F&amp;B Certification for F&amp;B establishments. </td>
