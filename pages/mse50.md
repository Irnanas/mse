<h1>Building a Green and Resilient Singapore</h1><br>

<b>2022 marks the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment's 50th Anniversary  (MSE50).</b>

<p>To commemorate this Golden Jubilee, a special  MSE50 logo has been designed. The MSE50 logo is based on the MSE logo and utilises the same font, its iconic brandmark and  
corporate colours.</p>
