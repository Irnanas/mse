### **FAQ**

**What is Singapore doing to tackle Climate Change?**
	
We have taken a three-pronged approach to tackle climate change. First, we want to better understand climate change and its impact. Second, we are mitigating climate change by reducing our emissions across all sectors; and third, we are taking measures to adapt to climate change. We also play our part as a responsible global citizen.

Understand climate change
To better understand climate change, we set up the Centre for Climate Research Singapore (CCRS) in 2013 to strengthen our capabilities in climate science. Today, CCRS is one of the most advanced climate research centres in the region specialising in tropical climate science. CCRS has embarked on the Third National Climate Change Study to provide an update of the projections for future climate change in Singapore and the region. 

Mitigate climate change
To mitigate climate change, we have put in place a comprehensive suite of measures to reduce emissions across all sectors over the years. These include switching to natural gas as a cleaner fuel for power generation, implementing a carbon tax applied uniformly to all sectors without exception, and greening our transport system and buildings.

Adapt to climate change
To adapt to the impact of climate change, we are prepared to spend an estimated S$100 billion over the next 50 to 100 years to protect Singapore against rising sea levels. Measures may include sea walls, tidal gates and pumping stations. In April 2020, PUB also assumed the role of our Coastal Protection Agency. By combining coastal protection responsibilities with its stormwater management functions, PUB will be well-positioned to look at inland and coastal flooding holistically.

You may refer to Singapore’s Climate Action Plan  for more information on Singapore’s mitigation and adaptation plans.

International and regional efforts
No single country will be able to address the challenges of climate change on its own. To effectively address a global problem like climate change and its impacts, we need a strong, collective global response.

This is why Singapore is a strong advocate for a multilateral, rules-based approach to addressing climate change. We work with other like-minded countries at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to push for the best possible multilateral deal on climate change. We participate actively in UNFCCC international negotiations and lend our support to the Conference of the Parties (COP) Presidencies to push for a good outcome at the climate conferences.

We have also taken an active role to galvanise climate action in the region. As Chair of ASEAN in 2018, we convened the first-ever Special ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Climate Action (SAMCA) and Expanded-SAMCA, where ASEAN, China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea reaffirmed our political commitments and discussed ways to step up regional climate action.

We have collaborated with partners to improve our understanding of climate change and its impact, through research and institutions like the ASEAN Specialised Meteorological Centre, which is based in Singapore. Through our Climate Action Package, we have partnered and supported fellow developing countries to build capacity in climate-related areas and to implement their Paris commitments and enhance climate action. Singapore has always been a strong supporter of multilateral approaches to global issues, and we work closely with other countries to tackle the climate challenge.



**Why can’t we ban smoking in all public areas?** 

Although the long-term goal is to prohibit smoking at all public places, except at Designated Smoking Areas (DSA) , we need to recognise that smokers also need space to smoke. The National Environment Agency (NEA) has been progressively extending the Smoking Regulations to more public places where the public are more likely to be exposed everyday to second-hand tobacco smoke, in consultation with the public and relevant stakeholders.

In 2013, the NEA extended the smoking prohibition to common areas in residential buildings, sheltered walkways, linkways, overhead bridges, outdoor compounds of hospitals and a five metre buffer zone around bus shelters.

In June 2016, the smoking ban was also extended to include more public areas such as, reservoirs and more than 400 parks. These include parks under the purview of JTC Corporation, parks in public housing estates, which are managed by the respective Town Councils, and neighbourhood parks, under NParks, which are within private housing estates.

Since 30 June 2017, NEA also stopped accepting applications for smoking corners in all food retail establishments. Existing smoking corners will remain until the current licence expires. Food retail establishments with smoking corners are required to demarcate the smoking corner clearly, but setting up of physical partitions is not compulsory.

Since January 2019, public areas within the Orchard Road precinct was designated as a No Smoking Zone (NSZ). Brochures listings of the locations of DSAs are available at shopping malls and point-of-sales of tobacco products. Signage and advertisements are also found at lamp posts and bins in the erected areas, selected bus stops and on buses that ply Orchard Road.

More information can be found at the NEA’s website [here](https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/smoking-prohibition/smoking-prohibition-extension). 


	
**How does the Ministry mitigate burning of incense/joss paper in public places?**

Currently, there are no regulations against the burning of incense in public places. Being a multi-cultural society, the Government encourages members of public, including temples and residents, to practise graciousness and consideration for the environment and neighbouring premises, when carrying out religious practices in public places. The public is advised to clean up the place after they have made their offerings. When burning joss paper, candles etc., they should make use of the proper pits and containers provided at the designated points, such as those provided by the Town Councils. 


  
**How can I report illegal hawking?**

The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) is the reviewing agency for all illegal hawking issues. You may share your feedback and report on any illegal hawking matters via the SFA's [feedback form](https://www.sfa.gov.sg/feedback).



**How does the Ministry control air pollution from industries in Singapore?**

The National Environment Agency (NEA) evaluates the hazard and pollution impact of industries to ensure that they do not contribute to unmanageable pollution, health and safety hazards. An industry is allowed to be set up only if it is sited in an appropriate industrial estate, and can comply with the pollution control requirements.

NEA checks the designs of industrial plants and pollution control equipment at the building plan stage for compliance with pollution control requirements. Industries need to conduct source emission tests on their own, or engage accredited consultants to monitor their air emissions regularly, and to take measures to ensure their compliance with the prescribed air emission standards.

NEA conducts regular inspections on industries to ensure that pollution control equipment is maintained and operated properly. NEA also conducts source tests on gaseous emissions, fuel analyses and smoke observations of chimneys. 

NEA’s Source Emission Test Scheme allows industries to monitor their air emissions regularly, and to take measures to ensure compliance with prescribed standards.
