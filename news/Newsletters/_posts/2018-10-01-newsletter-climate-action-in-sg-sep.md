**A Greener Changi Airport**  

Singapore’s Changi Airport achieved Level Three in the Airport Carbon Accreditation programme in May this year. Between 2016 to 2017, Changi Airport undertook more than 10 eco-friendly initiatives. These included: installation of solar panels; rooftop sensors to detect sunlight and control skylight panels – reducing the need for artificial lighting; and using food waste digesters to convert more than 250 tonnes of food into water last year.
