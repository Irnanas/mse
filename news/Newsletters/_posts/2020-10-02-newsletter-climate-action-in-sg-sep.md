#### Climate Action in SG (Sep 2020)  

**Ensuring Food Security**  

The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) plans to triple local production of food by 2030 to mitigate potential risks to Singapore’s food supply due to factors such as climate change, diseases and disruptions to global trade. To overcome land scarcity, it is exploring the use of alternative spaces, and has awarded tenders for urban farming at 9 multi-storey carparks in public residential areas. These new urban farming sites will employ innovative features that grow more produce while utilising less resources.

**Singapore’s first integrated waste and water treatment facility**  

Set to be completed in phases starting 2025, Tuas Nexus combines PUB, Singapore’s National Water Agency’s Tuas Water Reclamation Plant and the National Environment Agency’s Integrated Waste Management Facility in a single location. The facility not only optimises land use, it will harness multiple synergies, and is expected to result in carbon savings of more than 200,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide annually. The facility will be 100% energy self-sufficient, marking another step forward for Singapore’s pursuit of sustainable development.

**Building a circular economy**  

The National Environment Agency has issued a Request for Proposal to study the technical and economic feasibility of recovering mixed landfilled materials, and to find suitable applications for them. The Agency is also looking to study the feasibility and design of a pilot Plastic Recovery Facility (PRF) to convert recovered plastic waste through chemical recycling into higher-value products such as pyrolysis oil. If successful, these initiatives could close the waste loop for Singapore, and contribute towards a circular economy with zero waste.  

**Working with G20 countries towards a sustainable future**  

At the G20 Agriculture and Water Ministers Meeting, Ms Grace Fu, Singapore’s Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, spoke on prioritising water, food and resource security, and strengthening resilience through pursuing synergies and closing resource loops. Dr Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment, shared on identifying sustainable solutions to prepare for a carbon and resource-constrained future at the G20 Environment Ministers Meeting.
