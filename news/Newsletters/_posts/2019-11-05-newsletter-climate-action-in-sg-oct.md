#### Climate Action in SG (Oct 2019)  

*A monthly e-newsletter on Singapore’s sustainable development and climate action efforts*  

**Singapore Hosts Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Meetings**  

Singapore is proud to have hosted the IPCC AR6 Synthesis Report Scoping Meeting and the 57th Session of the IPCC Bureau from 21 - 25 Oct 2019. At the opening ceremony, Mr Masagos Zulkifli, Singapore’s Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, spoke on the important role that the IPCC played in providing robust, objective and transparent scientific assessments to policymakers. Minister Masagos also shared on Singapore’s plans to strengthen its climate science capabilities.  

**Engaging the Public on Climate Science**  

Singapore’s Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources, together with the Singapore Management University and with support from the IPCC, organised a public symposium entitled ‘Sea Level Rise in Southeast Asia’ on 23 October 2019. Singapore’s Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources, Dr Amy Khor, spoke on Singapore’s three-pronged approach to tackling climate change: (i) Building local climate science capabilities; (ii) Reducing emissions and building resilience; and (iii) Regional cooperation.  

**Singapore Participates in Pre-COP25**  

Minister Masagos Zulkifli was in San José, Costa Rica, from 8 – 10 Oct 2019 for the Preparatory Meeting of the 25th Conference of the Parties (Pre-COP25) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Minister Masagos spoke on the need for clear, credible and effective rules on the international carbon market, to achieve higher ambition levels and unlock innovative solutions to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, while maintaining environmental integrity. He also spoke on strengthening climate action by supporting developing countries through capacity building; and engaging all stakeholders.  

**Partnerships to Build Climate Action Capacity**  

The National University of Singapore’s Centre for International Law together with Singapore’s Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources, Singapore’s National Climate Change Secretariat, and the New Zealand High Commission Singapore organised a two- day workshop entitled ‘Decoding the Paris Rulebook for Southeast Asia’. The workshop saw representatives from all 10 ASEAN Member States sharing and learning about key issues pertaining to the practical implementation of the Paris Rulebook, sustainable climate finance, and preparations for the Global Stocktake in 2023.  

**Singapore’s Tuas Nexus Awarded Most Innovative Water-Energy Nexus Project**  

Singapore’s Tuas Nexus, the world’s first energy self- sufficient greenfield facility integrating used water treatment and waste management in a single facility, was named the “Most Innovative Water-Energy Nexus Project”, at the International Desalination Association (IDA) World Congress on 23 Oct 2019, in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Through its operations, Tuas Nexus will generate excess electricity sufficient for 300,000 flats, and achieve annual carbon savings equivalent to taking 42,500 cars off the roads.  

**Singapore Sets New Solar Capacity Target of 2 GWp by 2030**  

Singapore will be working towards achieving a new solar capacity target of at least 2 gigawatt-peak (GWp) by 2030, an almost eight-fold increase from the current installed capacity. This will meet the annual power needs of around 350,000 households in Singapore. To address solar intermittency and enhance grid resilience, Singapore will also work towards an energy storage deployment target of 200 MW beyond 2025.  

**Expansion of Deployment of Floating Solar PV Systems**  

Construction works have started for two 1.5 MWp floating solar PV systems on Singapore’s Bedok and Lower Seletar Reservoirs. Together with an existing solar array, the floating solar systems will meet 30% of the energy needs of the installations at the reservoirs. Adding to these efforts will be one of the world’s largest floating solar PV system of 50 MWp, to be deployed at Tengeh Reservoir by 2021.
