#### Climate Action in SG (Sep 2019)  

*A monthly e-newsletter on Singapore’s sustainable development and climate action efforts*  

**Singapore’s Climate Change Efforts**  

At the United Nations Climate Action Summit on 23 September 2019, Singapore’s Prime Minister, Mr Lee Hsien Loong, shared Singapore’s efforts to mitigate climate change by developing creative solutions within its constraints. He also spoke on how Singapore was working with other countries, through initiatives like the Climate Action Package, and the establishment of the Southeast Asia Disaster Risk Insurance Facility - with the support of Japan and the World Bank - to provide flood risk pooling for the region.  

**Landmark Resource Sustainability Bill Passed in Singapore**  

Singapore’s Resource Sustainability Bill was passed in Parliament on 4 September 2019, giving legislative effect to upstream regulatory measures targeting priority waste streams. This Bill will enable Singapore to adopt a circular economy approach to waste and resource management, and bring it closer to its aspiration to be a Zero Waste Nation. The reading of the Bill was attended by representatives from the People, Private and Public Sectors.  

**Singapore Strengthens Flood Protection Infrastructure*8  

PUB, Singapore’s National Water Agency, completed the drainage improvement works for the Bukit Timah First Diversion Canal in September 2019, a complex S$300 million project spanning seven years and three phases. With the expansion, the Bukit Timah First Diversion Canal is now better equipped to deal with intense rainfall events. This follows the completion of the Stamford Diversion Canal and Stamford Detention Tank last year, which took four years of construction. There are ongoing drainage projects at 66 locations around Singapore currently. These are part of PUB’s holistic “source-pathway-receptor” strategy to improve long-term flood protection.  

**Strengthening Green Financing For Sustainability**  

At the BNP Paribas Sustainability Forum on 18 September 2019, Mr Masagos Zulkifli, Singapore’s Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, spoke on the introduction of the Green Bond Grant Scheme in 2017 by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to spur the use of capital markets instruments for green financing. To date, over S$6 billion of green bonds have been issued. The scheme, now known as the Sustainable Bond Grant Scheme, was expanded this year to include social and sustainability bonds.  

**Environmental Champions Recognised For Their Contributions**  

Singapore’s President, Mdm Halimah Yacob, presented Singapore’s highest environmental accolade – the President’s Award for the Environment – to three deserving winners, Elias Park Primary School, Mee Toh School and Singtel on 26 September 2019. The award recognises and honours champions from the People, Private and Public sectors for their sustained contributions to Singapore’s environment.  

**Working with Singaporeans to Co-create Solutions For a Zero Waste Nation**  

Singapore’s Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources convened its inaugural #RecycleRight Citizens’ Workgroup on 21 September 2019. Involving 48 Singaporeans from diverse backgrounds, the workgroup members are invited to co-create solutions to improve household recycling. The workgroup was provided with relevant information on Government policies, survey findings on household recycling behaviours and public education materials, and access to subject matter experts. They are expected to present their ideas and recommendations to the Ministry on 20 October 2019.
