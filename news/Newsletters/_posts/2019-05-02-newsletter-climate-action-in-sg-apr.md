#### Climate Action in SG (Apr 2019)  

*A monthly e-newsletter on Singapore’s sustainable development and climate action efforts*  

**Sustainable Development - Green Silk Road Forum**  

Minister Masagos Zulkifli, Singapore’s Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, attended the ‘Green Silk Road Forum’ in Beijing, People’s Republic of China, on 25 April. At the meeting, Minister Masagos spoke on how the green development of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) can be achieved through ‘3 Builds’ (三大建设): (1) Building sustainably; (2) Building innovatively; and (3) Building partnerships.  

The BRI International Green Development Coalition (BRIGC) is an opportunity to implement the BRI in an open, transparent and inclusive manner and support the multilateral, rules-based approach to addressing environmental change. As co-chair, Singapore will work with the other co-chairs to help build a framework for BRI countries to develop sustainably, and deliver tangible benefits for people and the planet.  

Minister Masagos also met with Mr Li Ganjie, Minister for Ecology and Environment, People’s Republic of China. They discussed deepening engagement and cooperation to develop innovative and sustainable solutions to turn trash into treasure.  

**Year Towards Zero Waste – Public Consultations**  

The Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) partnered NGOs ‘Zero Waste SG’ and ‘Lepak In SG’ to conduct two focus group discussions in the month of April themed: ‘Adopting a Zero Waste Mindset - Towards Sustainable Consumption’ and ‘Recycle Right’. The discussions were part of the ongoing consultations for Singapore’s inaugural Zero Waste Masterplan.  

At the discussions, Dr Amy Khor, Singapore’s Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources, spoke on the need for a circular economy approach to managing resources, and how recycling was a key enabler.
