#### Climate Action in SG (Dec 2018)  

*A monthly e-newsletter on Singapore’s sustainable development and climate action efforts*  

**CLIMATE ACTION - COP24**  

Singapore welcomes the successful conclusion of the COP24, which has put in place the Katowice Rulebook – rules upon which Parties will report their commitments made in Paris. This is a fitting end to Singapore’s Year of Climate Action, which received a good response from the Public, Private, and People sectors in Singapore, and helped generate a momentum in the fight against climate change.  

Mr Masagos Zulkifli, Singapore’s Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, delivered Singapore’s National Statement at the COP24 on 12 December 2018, where he spoke on how success at COP24 would be measured, and how Singapore was doing its part in climate action.  

At COP24, Singapore played an active role in negotiations, co-facilitating two key negotiating tracks – Markets (trading Carbon Credits) and Mitigation (reducing GHGs), which Mr Masagos Zulkifli co-facilitated.  

Singapore submitted a summary of the discussions at the Special ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Climate Action (SAMCA) and Expanded SAMCA as input to the 2018 Talanoa Dialogue. Mr Masagos Zulkifli also participated in the Talanoa Dialogue Ministerial Roundtable at COP24.
