#### Climate projections for Singapore  

How is climate change going to affect Singapore in the future?  

**By 2100, we could experience mean sea level rise of up to 1 metre, an increase in daily mean temperatures as high as 4.6°C, and more extreme and intense weather events, which may lead to more frequent floods.**  

**RAINFALL**  

The contrast between the wet months (Nov to Jan) and dry months (Feb and Jun to Sep) will likely become more pronounced. Increasing trends in both intensity and frequency of heavy rainfall events are expected as the world gets warmer.  

**DAILY TEMPERATURE**  

Daily mean temperatures are projected to increase by 1.4°C to 4.6°C towards the end of this century (2070 to 2099), compared with the baseline period of 1980 to 2009.       

**SEA LEVEL**

Sea levels are projected to rise by up to about 1m by 2100, compared with the baseline period of 1980 to 2009.  

**FREQUENCY OF WARM DAYS AND NIGHTS**  

More warm days and warm nights for Feb to Sep are projected throughout the 21st Century.  

**WIND**  

Singapore will continue to be influenced by the northeast and southwest monsoons with a potential increase in wind speeds during the northeast monsoon season.
