#### Climate Action in SG (Jan 2021)

**Closing the Plastic Waste Loop**

Singapore’s National Environment Agency has awarded the tender for a feasibility study and design of a pilot plastic recovery facility (PRF) to HTP GmbH & Co. KG. The PRF will take in domestic waste from households and trade premises, and sort and recover various plastic polymer types such as Polyethylene (PE) and Polypropylene (PP) to be further treated in chemical recycling plants. Recovered plastics can be converted into higher-value products such as pyrolysis oil, serving as feedstock to manufacture new plastics and chemicals. The PRF will help to close the plastic waste loop in Singapore, and take the country closer towards its vision of becoming a Zero Waste nation.

**Building “Net Zero” Cities**

At the World Economic Forum’s Davos Agenda 2021 session on “Building “Net Zero” Cities”, Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, spoke on Singapore’s approach towards achieving net zero emissions. As a small city state, Singapore faces many inherent constraints such as limited renewable energy sources. However, Singapore has continued to pursue sustainability efforts through integrated planning and execution. This includes using data to drive low-carbon solutions, coordinated efforts across the whole of government, and close collaboration with industries, financiers and the broader community to effectively implement green urban solutions. 


**Strengthening Resource Resilience in the face of Climate Change**

At the Climate Adaptation Summit 2021, Minister Grace Fu shared Singapore’s experience in preparing for the impacts of climate change, including investing in technology and innovative planning. The upcoming Tuas Nexus is a good example of how the country is strengthening its water resilience. Due for completion in 2025, Tuas Nexus will be an integrated water and solid waste treatment facility. Besides having advanced solid waste treatment facilities, it will also be energy self-sufficient with excess electricity exported to the national grid. Such novel solutions will continue to contribute significantly to Singapore’s efforts towards sustainability, and adaptation and mitigation of climate change.
