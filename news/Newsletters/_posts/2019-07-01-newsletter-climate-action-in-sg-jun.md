#### Climate Action in SG (Jun 2019)  

*A monthly e-newsletter on Singapore’s sustainable development and climate action efforts*  

**Climate Action - European Commission Conference on International Carbon Markets**  

Mr Masagos Zulkifli, Singapore’s Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, attended the European Commission Conference on International Carbon Markets in Brussels, Belgium, on 3 June 2019. At the meeting, Minister Masagos spoke on the importance of finalising the rules on international carbon trading under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.  

**Sustainable Development - G20 Ministerial Meeting on Energy Transitions and Global Environment**  

Dr Amy Khor, Singapore’s Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources, attended the G20 Ministerial Meeting on Energy Transitions and Global Environment on 16 June 2019. At the meeting, Dr Khor shared Singapore’s efforts to strengthen domestic and regional resilience to climate change, including supporting the establishment of the Southeast Asia Disaster Risk Insurance Facility (SEADRIF).  

**Sustainable Development - Ecosperity Conference 2019**  

At the Ecosperity Conference on 6 June 2019, Minister Masagos Zulkifli shared that growth could be pursued in a resource and carbon-constrained world by building up 3 “Resiliences”: 1) Climate resilience; 2) Resource resilience; and 3) Economic resilience. Minister Masagos also spoke on how businesses must embrace circular economy solutions in their operations.  

**Singapore’s First Large-scale Floating Solar System**  

PUB, Singapore’s national water agency, will deploy a 50 megawatt-peak solar photovoltaic (PV) system on Tengeh Reservoir by 2021. When completed, it will be one of the largest single floating solar PV systems in the world. It is expected to offset 7% of PUB’s current energy needs, equivalent to removing 6,000 cars off Singapore’s roads.  

**Encouraging Industrial Water Recycling and Conservation Solutions**  

The PUB has set aside S$26 million to support larger water users in implementing water recycling and water conservation solutions within their premises. A total of 22 projects have been implemented to date, with 13 more to be completed within the next two years. The potential water savings will be equivalent to the water demand of over 68,000 households.
