**Celebrating the Year Towards Zero Waste**  

2019 is a milestone year for Singapore’s journey towards Zero Waste. At the Year Towards Zero Waste Appreciation Lunch on 25 Nov 2019, Singapore’s Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, Mr Masagos Zulkifli, announced that Singapore would soon begin a field trial to assess the in-situ environmental performance of NEWSand –  a construction material converted from incineration bottom ash. When implemented, NEWSand would allow Singapore to close its waste loop, and extend the lifespan of Singapore’s only landfill, Semakau Island.

**Reimagining Businesses for Resilience**  

Minister Masagos Zulkifli attended the Global Compact Network Singapore Summit themed “Reimagining Businesses for Resilience” on 12 November 2019. He spoke on the need for businesses to transform in the face of climate change, such as by embracing circular economy practices, adopting low-carbon solutions, and integrating Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles into their operations.  

**Climate Action through Green Investments**  

The Monetary Authority of Singapore has set up a US$2 billion green investments programme to invest in public market investment strategies with a strong green focus. This would help to support the Singapore financial centre in promoting environmentally sustainable projects and mitigate climate change risks in Singapore and the region.  

**Strengthening Food Security through Innovation**  

To achieve Singapore’s vision of producing 30% of its nutritional needs locally by 2030, the Singapore Food Agency provides farmers with funding support to adopt and develop new farming technologies and systems. One such innovation is the Eco-Ark, a purpose-built floating closed containment fish farm that can yield close to 20 times more fish than other coastal farms.
