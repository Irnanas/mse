#### Climate Action in SG (Feb 2019)  

*A monthly e-newsletter on Singapore’s sustainable development and climate action efforts*  

**Sustainable Development - Year Towards Zero Waste**  

Singapore has designated 2019 as our Year Towards Zero Waste to raise awareness of waste issues, and to rally Singaporeans to treasure our precious resources. We aim to build a strong 3R (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle) culture in Singapore, and to adopt a circular economy approach to resource management.  

**Sustainable Development – 3rd A/P Forum**  

Singapore hosted 38 countries for the 3rd Forum of Ministers and Environment Authorities of Asia Pacific from 23 - 25 January 2019. The Forum was held to identify priorities and emerging environmental issues from the region, in preparation for the upcoming UN Environment Assembly in March.  

**Climate Action – Food Security**  

The Singapore Food Agency will be set up on 1 April 2019 to oversee and ensure Singapore’s food safety and security amidst rising global food demand and challenges such as climate change impacts on food production.  

**Sustainable Development - Year Towards Zero Waste**  

Dr Amy Khor, Singapore’s Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources, met with local NGOs, youths and other partners on 22 February 2019 for a dialogue on Singapore’s Zero Waste Masterplan and sustainability initiatives.
