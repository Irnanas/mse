#### Climate Action in SG (Jan 2020)  

**Supporting the Multilateral System of Climate Action**  

Mr Masagos Zulkifli, Singapore’s Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, delivered Singapore’s National Statement on 10 Dec 2019 at the UNFCCC COP-25, where he spoke on four key aspects to strengthen the multilateral system of climate action:  

(i) Honouring and implementing pledges; (ii) Completing the Paris Agreement Work Programme; (iii) Mobilising national climate actions; and (iv) Strengthening solidarity through partnerships.

**Strengthening Climate Action Capacities in ASEAN through Partnerships**  

Singapore and the NDC Partnership, with support from the UNFCCC Secretariat and the 2050 Pathways Platform, organised a workshop from 13-15 Jan 2020 entitled: “Enhancing Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)”. The workshop, an initiative under Singapore’s Climate Action Package, was attended by ASEAN representatives and provided a platform for participants to discuss opportunities, challenges, and options to enhance and implement their NDCs or climate pledges.  

**Enhancing Flood Management with Technology**  

PUB, Singapore’s National Water Agency, has developed a rainfall monitoring and prediction system capable of providing early heavy rainfall warnings. With the increased likelihood of extreme weather events due to climate change, this advancement will help to enhance PUB’s response time to potential flash floods that may occur across Singapore.  

**Building a Healthy and Sustainable City**  

How will climate change affect the living environment in cities? What is Singapore doing to adapt to the impacts of climate change? Mr Masagos Zulkifli, Singapore’s Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, shared his views on these issues with the Centre for Liveable Cities. He also outlined Singapore’s approach to fostering a liveable environment in light of these challenges.
