#### Climate Action in SG (Oct 2020)  

**Creating our low carbon energy future**  

At this year’s Singapore International Energy Week (SIEW), the Singapore Government announced a S$49 million Low-Carbon Energy Research Funding Initiative to support research and test-bedding efforts in low carbon energy technologies, such as hydrogen and carbon capture, utilisation and storage. Singapore and Australia also signed a Memorandum of Understanding on cooperation to advance low-emissions solutions. Singapore also announced that it would be embarking on a 2-year trial for electricity imports from Malaysia to Singapore. The trial aims to assess and refine the technical and regulatory frameworks for importing electricity into Singapore, to facilitate larger-scale imports from the region in future.  

**Improving plastic recycling rates**  

The National Environment Agency (NEA) and Shell are jointly studying the feasibility of chemically recycling plastic waste in Singapore. The study will look into waste segregation facilities and plastic pyrolysis plants to recycle Singapore’s plastic waste. In addition to diverting plastics from incineration, chemical recycling will help reduce carbon emissions, close the plastic waste loop, and create new jobs and capabilities. The study complements NEA’s consultancy study on the feasibility of developing a pilot Plastic Recovery Facility in Singapore, and is part of the Government’s efforts to take the country closer towards its vision of a Zero Waste Nation.  

**Collaborating to ensure the sustainability of food supply chains**  

At the 42nd Meeting of the ASEAN Ministers on Agriculture and Forestry (AMAF), 20th AMAF Plus Three and 6th ASEAN-India Ministerial Meeting on Agriculture and Forestry, Dr Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment, together with the ASEAN Ministers, reaffirmed their commitment to ensure sustainable food sources and the unimpeded flow of food. The AMAF and related meetings are important platforms for collaboration between countries to strengthen the resilience of the region’s food supply chains.

**Adopting clean energy**  

Speaking at the 7th Asia Clean Energy Summit, Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, announced: (i) a research agreement between Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIS) and Fred Olsen Renewables to develop floating photovoltaic systems; (ii) the establishment of Maxeon Solar Technologies’ global head office and R&D centre in Singapore; and (iii) a Memorandum of Understanding between ENGIE Factory and EDB New Ventures to build a portfolio of new sustainability start-ups that will help companies in Singapore and Southeast Asia decarbonise more quickly and profitably. These efforts in clean energy will contribute significantly to Singapore’s sustainable development and climate mitigation efforts.
