#### Climate Action in SG (Aug 2019)  

*A monthly e-newsletter on Singapore’s sustainable development and climate action efforts*  

**Singapore To Invest S$100 Billion In Climate Change Defences**  

At the 2019 National Day Rally, Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong spoke on the need to understand, mitigate, and adapt to climate change. This includes making necessary long-term investments to protect Singapore, a low-lying island city-state, from rising sea levels.  

In an interview with CNA938, Mr Masagos Zulkifli, Singapore’s Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, spoke on the urgency for climate action and how Singapore’s efforts to move towards a circular economy will help fight climate change.  

**Zero Waste Masterplan Charts Singapore’s Path Towards Becoming A Zero Waste Nation**  

Singapore launched its inaugural Zero Waste Masterplan on 30 August 2019, and announced plans to reduce the waste it sends to its landfill by 30% by 2030. The Masterplan maps out Singapore’s key strategies to become more sustainable, resource- efficient, and climate-resilient, and will be supported by the recently passed Resource Sustainability Bill.  

**Singapore Opens World’s Largest Ceramic Membrane Water Treatment Plant**  

PUB, Singapore’s National Water Agency, opened the world’s largest ceramic membrane water treatment plant on 29 August 2019. The plant is the result of long- term investments in dedicated research and trials in ceramic membrane technology. It is part of Singapore’s efforts to ensure a reliable supply of clean and safe drinking water, and improves energy and water efficiency in water production.  

**Regional Cooperation Crucial In Tackling Transboundary Haze**  

Mr Masagos Zulkifli, Singapore’s Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, met his ASEAN counterparts at the 21st Sub-Regional Ministerial Steering Committee on Transboundary Haze Pollution on 6 August 2019, to discuss joint efforts to eradicate transboundary haze in the region.
