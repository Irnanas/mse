#### Climate Action in SG (Dec 2020)  

**Novel food as a sustainable food option**  

The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) has approved the sale of cultured meat produced by US food company Eat Just, making Singapore the first country to approve the sale of lab-grown meat. The chicken bites by Eat Just is the first product to pass SFA’s evaluation process under the new regulatory framework and will be sold in retail stores by late-2022. Eat Just will also be basing its Asia headquarters in Singapore. Beyond regulations, the government is also committed to growing a vibrant and forward-looking agri-tech and food ecosystem, to provide a safe and sustainable food supply for Singapore. 


**Investing in sustainability research and innovation**

Singapore will invest S$25 billion in research, innovation and enterprise in the next 5 years. One of the four key domains under the Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) 2025 plan is Urban Solutions and Sustainability, which includes research into new challenges posed by climate change, decarbonisation, resource resilience, and the enhancement of Singapore’s built environment and liveability. The blueprint affirms Singapore’s commitment to building a knowledge-based and innovation-driven economy. These efforts in research and innovation will continue to contribute significantly to Singapore’s sustainable development journey.

**Charting a sustainable recovery from COVID-19**

At the 16th Joint Council for Bilateral Cooperation, the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment of Singapore and the Ministry of Ecology and Environment of the People’s Republic of China adopted a Joint Paper on Enhancing Cooperation in the Post-COVID-19 Era that will: (i) strengthen collective action through multilateral cooperation; (ii) promote green and sustainable development through innovative policies; and (iii) facilitate technical cooperation. The two countries also signed a Memorandum of Understanding on Food Safety Cooperation to promote food safety and health standards for consumers, and  enhance food trade. The meeting marked 30 years of diplomatic relations, reaffirming cooperation in efforts towards sustainability and strengthened resilience in the recovery from COVID-19.

**Collaborating with the community in circular ecosystem for food production**

Sustainability @ Tampines Park is Singapore’s first community-based circular ecosystem for food production. The ecosystem includes a Black Soldier Fly (BSF) Facility, Tilapia Fish Farm, and Vertical High-Tech Vegetable Farm. This pilot is part of efforts to transform Tampines into an eco-town, and is an example of how Singapore is using alternative spaces to grow food and reduce food waste. Residents contribute food waste to the BSF facility, and the BSF larvae break down the waste into fertiliser, which is used to enrich the vertical farm that produces vegetables for the community. The larvae can also be used as fish feed. These efforts will help to lessen waste and strengthen the community’s food  resilience.
