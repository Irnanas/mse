#### Climate Action in SG (Jul 2020)  

The Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources has been renamed the **Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE).** The renaming of the Ministry reflects the Singapore Government’s emphasis on sustainable development, amidst long-term challenges stemming from climate change and global resource constraints.  

**Strengthening Singapore’s Water Security**  

Singapore’s fourth desalination plant, the Keppel Marina East Desalination Plant (KMEDP), commenced commercial operations on 29 June 2020. The KMEDP is a public-private partnership and Singapore’s first large-scale, dual-mode desalination plant. It is capable of producing 137,000 cubic metres (approximately 30 million gallons) of fresh drinking water per day. This will further strengthen Singapore’s water supply resilience.

The Workgroup’s efforts will support Singapore’s “30 by 30” goal, which is to meet 30 per cent of Singapore’s nutritional needs with locally-produced food by 2030.  

**Towards a Zero Waste Singapore**  

Singapore is developing NEWSand from slag produced from the high temperature gasification of municipal solid waste. NEWSand can be used as construction material for roads and non-structural concrete.
