#### Climate Action in SG (Nov 2020)  

**Encouraging climate-friendly action in households**  

Singapore celebrated the 30th anniversary of the Clean and Green Singapore movement on 28 November 2020. The movement aims to inspire Singaporeans to care for and protect our environment by adopting a clean, green and sustainable lifestyle. At the event, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat announced that eligible households could apply for vouchers to purchase LED lights, energy-efficient refrigerators and water-efficient shower fittings under a S$25 million Climate-Friendly Household package to support households to take climate action.

**Strengthening our climate science capabilities**  

Singaporeâ€™s National Environment Agency (NEA) recently set up the Climate Science Research Programme Office (CSRPO). The Office will oversee research grant programmes such as the National Sea Level Programme (NSLP), and lead efforts in formulating and implementing the National Climate Science Research Masterplan. Under the NSLP, grants have been awarded to two research projects to better understand sea level change in the region. These efforts will help to build a vibrant research landscape in Singapore, and strengthen our climate science capabilities in tackling the potential impact of climate change.

Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, announced the first grant call for the S$50 million SG Eco Fund on 25 November 2020. The Fund will support ground-up projects by individuals, groups and companies that involve the community and advance environmental sustainability in Singapore.
