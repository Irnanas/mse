#### Climate Action in SG (Aug 2020)  

**Towards a Sustainable Singapore**  

In an addendum to the President’s Address at the opening of Singapore’s 14th term of Parliament, Singapore’s Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Ms Grace Fu said that the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) would push for a green recovery from COVID-19, to support a competitive transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient future. The Ministry expects to create over 55,000 new and upgraded jobs over the next 10 years as it pursues sustainable development.  

**Partnerships for Climate Action**  

Singapore’s ‘Climate Action Week’ took place from 15 – 21 August. Over 30 ground-up initiatives by 27 partners from the 3P (People, Private and Public) sectors were organised. This annual event helps sustain the momentum for climate action in Singapore, and is part of MSE’s efforts to foster deeper partnerships with stakeholders and citizens, and co-create and co-deliver solutions to Singapore’s environmental challenges.  

**Emerging Stronger from COVID-19**

In a dialogue organised by Eco-Business and Sembcorp Industries, Minister Grace Fu spoke on the importance of keeping up the fight against climate change amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Singapore is doing so by building up our climate, resource and economic resilience.  

**Strengthening Singapore’s Food Security**

At the WeLL (We go Local and Low-Carbon) Dinner organised by the National University of Singapore, Dr Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment, spoke on the efforts Singapore was taking to strengthen its food security. This includes increasing local food production; a $30 million grant to accelerate local production of eggs, leafy vegetables and fish; and opening up more urban farming spaces such as rooftops.  

**Greening Buildings to Fight Climate Change**  

Singapore’s Building and Construction Authority (BCA)’s Green Mark Award, which promotes sustainability in the built environment, was awarded to 376 projects this year, including 16 overseas. There is also an upward trend of building owners going for higher tier Green Mark Certifications. This is indicative of the industry’s awareness of the positive impact of green buildings in the fight against climate change.  

**Singapore’s Waterworks named ‘Water Project of the Year’**  

Singapore’s Choa Chu Kang Waterworks (CCKWW) was named ‘Water Project of the Year’ at the Global Water Awards 2020, making it PUB, Singapore’s national water agency’s third consecutive win at the annual Awards. The CCKW houses the largest ceramic membrane system in the world, which treats water economically, and is a key component of Singapore’s water treatment capabilities.
