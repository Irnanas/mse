#### SPEECH BY MS GRACE FU, MINISTER FOR SUSTAINABILITY AND THE ENVIRONMENT, AT THE LAUNCH OF CITY SPROUTS&#39; SUSTAINABILITY CENTRE ON 27 APRIL 2022

Mr Chee Zhi Kin and Mr Zac Toh, Co-Founders of City Sprouts,

Members of the SG Eco Fund Advisory Committee,

Ladies and Gentlemen

Good morning. It is my pleasure to be here today for the launch of the Sustainability Centre at City Sprouts.

Last year, we launched the Singapore Green Plan 2030, a whole-of-nation movement to advance Singapore&#39;s national agenda on sustainable development. Spearheaded by five Ministries and supported by the Whole of Government, the Green Plan charts concrete and ambitious targets for the rest of this decade. It covers multiple dimensions, from additional green spaces, greener commutes and the use of cleaner energy, to developing Singapore as a sustainable tourism destination and diversifying our food supply.

**CO-CREATING A MORE SUSTAINABLE SINGAPORE**

As we strive towards a greener and low-carbon future, changes to the way we live, work and play are needed. And for this transition to be an inclusive one, we must build a new social compact for the changes to come. Every individual, household, organisation and business can play their part in the green transition. Over the past year, we have engaged more than 25,000 corporates, youths, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and community members in initiatives such as the OneMillionTrees movement, Green Plan Conversations and the Youth Action Challenge. Through these engagements, we tap on the energy, experience and ideas of our partners to co-create and co-deliver solutions for a more sustainable Singapore.

Social enterprises such as City Sprouts contribute to our national sustainability movement. I am happy to see that the Sustainability Centre will serve as a green sandbox where sustainable technologies can be test-bedded. In addition, it will enable visitors to experience sustainability first-hand. The Centre has deployed a green roof mat system which creates a cooling effect for the indoor space, and an algae wall that helps to purify air and absorb carbon dioxide. I hope this sustainability showcase will excite the community and get people thinking about how they can apply such concepts to their homes or offices.

**CELEBRATING SG ECO FUND GRANTEES**

This Sustainability Centre is one of the projects supported by the SG Eco Fund. Since its inception in November 2020, the SG Eco Fund has awarded over $6.6 million to 105 projects across the private, public and people sectors. In the most recent grant call, the Fund received a total of 241 applications, of which 68 were awarded a total of $2.9 million. From edible gardens, community composting projects, e-waste upcycling to environmental campaigns, SG Eco Fund grantees are promoting sustainability through their sphere of influence. Farmily, a social enterprise, partnered with Kebun Baru Community Club to create a community urban farm that engages residents in growing edible plants and the recycling of food waste. ThePost Museum, which runs the Renew Earth Sweatshop programme, teaches students and the public on how to repair and repurpose their textile waste.

The SG Eco Fund also supports projects which demonstrate technological or social innovation. SusGain is using the grant to incorporate gamification in its application to incentivise eco-conscious actions. MyKilio is developing compostable mycelium-based materials from food waste, which can be used as eco-friendly packaging.

**SG ECO FUND&#39;S NEW GRANT CALL**

Today, I am happy to update you on the next SG Eco Fund grant call, which will open on 1 May. We have made several changes to the grant cycle to encourage more to take action. First, following the successful launch last year, the SG Eco Fund will now receive and process applications for the Sprout category all year round. This means greater access and convenience for community projects requesting funding of up to $10,000.

Second, the SG Eco Fund will extend the application period for the Main category from two months to four months, from 1 May to 31 August every year. This category is meant for projects that require funding between $10,000 and $1 million. These changes will make it easier for individuals and organisations to plan their projects in advance and turn their ideas into action.

**CONCLUSION**

Let me conclude. Creating a climate-resilient and liveable Singapore will require a concerted whole-of-nation effort. By collaborating across different sectors, we can build a strong national sustainability movement to help us achieve our climate ambitions. I encourage you to share insights and explore new partnerships with your fellow grantees and attendees who are present today. Thank you all for your passion and dedication to creating a better and greener Singapore. I look forward to meeting all of you during the tour later.

Thank you.
