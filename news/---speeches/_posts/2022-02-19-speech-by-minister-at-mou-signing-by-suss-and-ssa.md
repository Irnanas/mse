#### SPEECH BY MS GRACE FU, MINISTER FOR SUSTAINABILITY AND THE ENVIRONMENT, AT THE MOU SIGNING EVENT BETWEEN SINGAPORE UNIVERISTY OF SOCIAL SCIENCES AND SINGAPORE SCOUT ASSOCIATION ON 19 FEBRUARY 2022  

Prof Cheong Hee Kiat  
President, Singapore University of Social Sciences  

Dr Ang Hak Seng  
Director, Centre of Excellence for Social Good  

Mr Raymond Chia  
President, Singapore Scout Association  

Ladies and Gentlemen  

1	Good morning everyone. I thank the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) and the Singapore Scout Association (SSA) for inviting me to join you today.   

2	I am happy to hear that SUSS and SSA will be developing and delivering a United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Educational Programme to equip and empower our youth with an understanding of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through courses, workshops as well as community projects.  

**Urgency of Sustainable Development**  

3	The need for sustainable development has never been more urgent. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated many of the world’s biggest challenges, such as poverty, livelihood, healthcare, food insecurity, and inequality. Climate change is another existential challenge that poses a serious threat to humanity.  

4	Last year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its Sixth Assessment Report on climate change. The report showed that global warming will exceed 1.50C – 20C during the 21st century unless there are deep reductions in carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gas emissions in the coming decades. Every region in the world is expected to experience more droughts, intense and frequent rainfall events, and flooding. This underscores the urgency for countries to reduce greenhouse gases even as we emerge from the impact of the pandemic.  

**Singapore Green Plan 2030**  

5	As a low-lying island city-state, Singapore is particularly vulnerable to rising sea levels and extreme weather conditions. Climate change can also affect our access to critical resources such as food and water. With limited land and alternative energy options, Singapore faces much starker trade-offs in reducing our emissions and building our resilience to the impact of climate change. However, we are not starting from ground zero.  

6	Since our founding, Singapore has kept long-term sustainability in mind when developing our national policies. Rather than pursuing economic development at all costs, we have prioritised quality, inclusive and sustainable growth. We have preserved our natural environment to nurture a City in Nature, frozen the growth of the vehicle population, and have closed our water loop to strengthen water resilience for our population. As a result, Singaporeans today enjoy a clean and green Singapore.  

7	Last year, we launched the Singapore Green Plan 2030, which charts ambitious and concrete sectoral targets over the next ten years. The Green Plan touches on all aspects of our lives: from how we live and eat, to how we work and play. Its five pillars are supported by two key horizontal enablers: a Green Government, and a Green Citizenry.  

8	Realising this plan will require a whole-of-nation effort. We need all stakeholders – government agencies, corporates, youth, community – to contribute and build a sustainable future for generations to come.  

**Empowering Youths to Effect Change from the Ground Up**  

9 SUSS and SSA’s programme to equip youth with skills and knowledge in the SDGs is a good step towards empowering youth to act and contribute towards achieving inclusive and sustainable growth. Youths can plant seeds of sustainable development in their own spheres of influence, be it in the organisations they work in, education institutions they study at, or social enterprises they belong to.  

10 Edible Garden City is an example of a social enterprise that aims to balance sustainability with social goals. It advocates for food resilience and the ‘grow our own food movement’. Its initiatives include training and providing autistic adults with employment opportunities in urban farming.  

11	UglyFood is another example. It rescues blemished fresh produce from supermarkets and importers, and turns them into profit by creating cleaning agents and fruit juices. Through this, food that would have been thrown away is put to new uses, and food waste is reduced. These are just two examples of how our youths can drive sustainable development from the ground-up.  

12	I believe many of you here today are passionate about sustainability and have fresh and innovative ideas buzzing in your minds. I encourage you to transform your ideas into action. You can start small within your network, school or community, and build your idea over time. If you need support, you can tap on government funds such as my Ministry’s SG Eco Fund and MCCY’s National Youth Fund to get your initiative started. The process to apply is simple, and there are different categories which offer funding support of up to $1 million.   
 
**Conclusion**  

13	Let me conclude by once again commending SUSS and SSA’s collaboration. With better knowledge of SDGs in their toolbox, I believe youths can effect lasting and positive change from the ground up.  

14	I encourage all of you to learn more about the SDGs and step forward to lead by example. Together, we can build an inclusive and sustainable future for generations of Singaporeans.  

15	Thank you and have a pleasant day ahead.
