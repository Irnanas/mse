#### Speech by Dr Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment, at the 'Keep Clean, Singapore!' 2022 Campaign Closing Event on 28 May 2022

Ms Denise Phua,

Mayor, Central Singapore District

Mr Edward D&#39;Silva,

Chairman, Public Hygiene Council

Ladies and Gentlemen

Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today&#39;s closing event for the annual Keep Clean, Singapore! Campaign.

**Introduction**

2 This month-long campaign by the Public Hygiene Council (PHC) has been a productive one, with more than 365 clean-up activities organised across the island.

This is an encouraging sign that the wider community views the cleanliness of the environment as a shared responsibility – that our home does not end at our doorstep but rather the whole of Singapore.

3 It is with this collective mindset that we can ensure Singapore remains liveable, clean and green for future generations.

**Collaboration Across the Community**

4 Our reputation as a clean and green city would not have been possible without the support and collaborative effort from the community, including from businesses, schools, civic groups and grassroots organisations.

5 While the clean-up activities were commendable, I note that many littered items were collected– with cigarette butts being the most common form of litter found.

6 As the cigarette butts are small, it is easy to think that this act of littering will go unnoticed. What many do not realise is that cigarette butts are not only unsightly but also harmful, and cause significant negative impact to the environment. For example, the littered cigarette butts can take up to 10 years to break down and remain in the environment, leaving behind toxic chemicals that pose serious threats to us and our environment.

7 To demonstrate the seriousness of such irresponsible acts, we will be using some of the cigarette butts collected from these clean-up activities in the closing segment, as a reminder that the little things add up. Likewise, if we all do our part to keep our environment clean, our collective efforts will have a huge positive impact on our shared spaces.

**Building a Sustainable Clean Movement**

8 The changing social conditions and the varying landscape today calls for a more collaborative effort to engage the community on issues pertaining to cleanliness and hygiene. PHC&#39;s Keep Clean, Singapore! 2022 campaign message &quot;It&#39;s not a job, it&#39;s our home&quot; is a powerful rallying call for all of us to collectively keep Singapore, our home, truly clean.

**Conclusion**

9 I would like to express my appreciation to everyone who have participated in the clean-up activities thus far. I encourage all of you to continue on this journey with the PHC to keep Singapore our home, truly clean.

Thank you.
