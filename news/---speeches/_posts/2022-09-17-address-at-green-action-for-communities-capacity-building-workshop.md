#### Address by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, at the South West District's Green Action for Communities Capacity Building Workshop on 17 September 2022 

Ms Low Yen Ling, Mayor, South West District     

Ladies and Gentlemen.  

1 Good morning, everyone. I am happy to join you here today at the Green Action for Communities (GAC) capacity building workshop for the South West district.    

2 The GAC is a nationwide movement to harness the ideas and collective energy of our communities to help realise the Singapore Green Plan 2030. It brings together grassroots leaders and residents, like yourselves, to plan, organise and implement practical initiatives on the ground to better care for our environment and tackle climate change.   

**Singapore’s Net Zero Ambition**

3 Just last month, South Korea and Pakistan experienced unprecedented rainfall and floods. One-third of Pakistan was completely underwater. Pakistan’s Minister for Climate Change called the disaster “apocalyptic”. Meanwhile, China experienced a historic heatwave that dried up the Jialing River, allowing people to walk across the riverbed of a once gushing river. Earlier this year, India faced the highest temperatures on record for over a century because of a heatwave. This threatened the supply of wheat and resulted in an export ban.   

4 Singapore will not be spared from the impact of climate change. As a low-lying island state, Singapore is especially vulnerable to rising sea levels. It is therefore crucial that we move decisively towards a low-carbon future.   

5 At this year’s Budget, the Government announced plans to raise Singapore’s climate ambition and achieve net zero emissions by or around mid-century. What this means is that we will need to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, and explore ways to offset remaining emissions, such as new technologies that capture and remove emissions, nature-based solutions, or carbon credits.   

6 This transition to a low-carbon future is not something that the Government can do alone. It requires a whole-of-society effort – whether we are a citizen, consumer, worker or business owner – and will involve transformations in all aspects of our lives. Small actions like avoiding disposables, buying locally produced food and choosing energy-efficient appliances can create ripple effects, driving industries to develop greener and more sustainable solutions.   

**Taking Action Together**

7 It is heartening to note that Singaporeans do recognise that climate change is an urgent issue and many are willing to do their part. In the latest August 2022 poll by the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI), around four in five are aware of the Green Plan, consider climate change as a serious threat to Singapore’s survival and are willing to take action.    

8 Over the last few years, we have also seen more Singaporeans championing ground-up sustainability initiatives. These include urban farming, recycling of plastic and e-waste, and reducing food waste through food rescues.    

9 Let us continue the momentum through the GAC movement. You, our community leaders, have the enthusiasm and expertise to know what are the best green initiatives for your neighbours and your neighbourhoods.  We invite you to co-create sustainable solutions with us and rally our communities to take climate action -- not just to achieve the targets under our Green Plan, but to build a better, cleaner home for all of us, and to steward our shared resources for a better future for coming generations.    

**Forward Singapore**

10 The GAC also provides an opportunity for all of us to come together to discuss and shape Singapore’s future together under the Forward Singapore exercise launched by DPM Lawrence Wong recently. One of the important aspects of this national conversation is how we can build an even better home and steward our shared environmental resources for future generations. What do we want to see in Singapore’s future? What are we willing to do to reach the future we want? And what are the challenges that could hinder us?   

11 There is a Chinese saying, “前人种树, 后人乘凉”. This translates to the future generation enjoying the benefits a tree provides because the earlier generation first planted the seeds for the tree. As stewards, we must recognise that the cumulative outcomes of our current actions will endure beyond our generation, and our children’s generation. We must also recognise that how we steward our resources today will have an impact on those who come after us. As a society, we have to consider what we can do to better conserve finite, depleting natural resources, and what economic costs we are willing to bear, or what we are willing to go without, so we can leave behind a better and stronger Singapore for our future generations.    

12 While the Government can set the broad direction, we value the ideas and contributions of Singaporeans and want to partner you to realise our shared future. It is only with the collective commitment and action from the community that we can overcome challenges such as climate change. We are stronger when we work together.    

**Conclusion**

13 To conclude, I thank all of you for taking time out on a Saturday morning for this session. I am delighted to open the GAC workshop in the South West district today, and I look forward to hearing your ideas on how we can all work together to build a more sustainable Singapore for our future generations!   

14 Thank you.
