#### Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Packaging Data

**Mr Murali Pillai:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment what steps have been taken to proactively monitor compliance by companies with a turnover of more than $10 million to collect packaging data and develop plans to reduce, reuse and recycle packaging from 1 January 2021 ahead of the deadline to issue their respective reports to NEA by the 1st quarter of 2022 pursuant to Mandatory Packaging Reporting requirements.   

**Answer:**

1  Since 2019, the National Environment Agency (NEA) has actively reached out to companies obligated under the Mandatory Packaging Reporting (MPR) framework. This has been done through multiple channels such as electronic and hard-copy notifications, publications in major newspapers, media releases as well as virtual and physical engagement sessions. NEA has also worked with various industry associations and groups, such as the Singapore Chemical Industry Council, Singapore Association of Pharmaceutical Industries, Singapore Manufacturing Federation, and the Food Industry Association, to reach out to their members on the MPR obligations.     

2  NEA has conducted more than 150 industry briefings, as well as sector-specific and one-to-one consultation sessions for companies. Some of these are held under the Packaging Partnership Programme (PPP), an industry-led capability development programme for sustainable packaging waste management by the Singapore Manufacturing Federation in partnership with NEA. The PPP also organises training sessions for companies on the MPR requirements, and how companies can develop 3R (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) plans for packaging.   

3  NEA will send out final reminders to companies prior to the submission deadline of 31 March 2022, and will also continue to work with industry stakeholders to reach out to companies.
