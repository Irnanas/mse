#### Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Update on Investigations of Foul Odour in Air in Woodlands    
 
**Ms Mariam Jaafar:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether the Ministry can provide an update on the investigations of the foul odour in the air in Woodlands.

**Answer:**

1 In response to feedback on foul odour received from residents in Woodlands, the National Environment Agency (NEA) has carried out site inspections at industrial premises, construction sites and agricultural land in the nearby Woodlands and Lim Chu Kang. While there was no major plant upset or pollution incident at industrial premises and construction sites, NEA and relevant agencies identified some farms and composting sites in Lim Chu Kang with localised foul odour.

2 When a spike in feedback on foul odour was received in September and October 2021, the prevailing winds blew from the south or west. The westerly winds could have carried the foul odour from the farms and composting sites in Lim Chu Kang to the residential area in Woodlands, while light wind conditions overnight and in the early morning restricted the odour from dispersing, resulting in smell nuisance to residents.

3 Relevant agencies have been actively engaging the owners and occupiers of the identified premises to implement odour mitigation measures where feasible. Several agencies have also been piloting an initiative to work with members of the community to collect detailed smell feedback data. This would enable the agencies to better identify the sources of smell nuisance, and work with the source premises to address the odour issue.
