#### Oral Reply to Parliamentary Question on Climate-Friendly Households Programme by Mr Baey Yam Keng, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Leon Perera:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether the Ministry will consider increasing the value of the $150 Climate-Friendly Households Programme e-voucher for energy-efficient refrigerators given the significantly higher cost of a 3-tick refrigerator; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider covering more aspects of residents’ emission-emitting activities, such as through offering vouchers for bicycles.

**Mr Leon Perera:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment in view of the low take-up rate of the Climate-Friendly Households Programme, whether the Ministry has surveyed eligible households and conducted outreach to better understand the reasons for the low take-up rate.

**Answer:**

1 The Climate-Friendly Households Programme aims to encourage 1-, 2- and 3-room HDB households to make the switch to resource-efficient and climate-friendly appliances – refrigerators, LED lighting and shower fittings. In this way, households can also enjoy savings in utilities costs. From NEA’s earlier market survey on refrigerators, a $150 voucher amount was sufficient to defray the average incremental cost of energy efficient models.

2 To improve the programme take-up rate, NEA and PUB have been working with community partners to conduct outreach activities to residents. Posters on the Programme have also been displayed at Community Clubs and digital display panels at some HDB blocks. We will continue to monitor the take-up rate of the vouchers and review the Programme at an appropriate juncture.
