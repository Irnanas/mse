#### Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on KTVs that have Pivoted to Food and Beverage Operations   

**Dr Tan Yia Swam:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment of the 400 KTVS that pivoted to food and beverage and given licences, how many of them have commercial kitchens.

**Answer:**

1 Of the more than 400 nightlife establishments that were approved to pivot to Food and Beverage operations, 11 operate with a Food Shop (Restaurant) licence from the Singapore Food Agency (SFA), which requires a commercial kitchen. The rest operate with a Food Shop (Snack Counter) licence, which requires more basic food preparation equipment.

2 Enhanced Safe Management Measures (SMMs) have been introduced on top of existing ones for the F&amp;B sector to further reduce public health risks and facilitate enforcement checks. All pivoted nightlife establishments can only resume operations after they pass inspections and receive a conditional permit from the Ministry of Trade and Industry. This conditional permit imposes additional SMMs on these establishments, including installing CCTVs to monitor operations, removing public entertainment equipment like karaoke machines and pool tables from sight, and ensuring that food preparation facilities and menus comply with licencing conditions set by SFA.
