**Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Educating Young on Unacceptable Social Behaviours**

**Mr Gan Thiam Poh:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether the Ministry will work with other agencies to educate the young that high-rise littering, laundry dripping, and non-return of food trays after eating in hawker centers and coffee shops are unacceptable social behaviors.

**Answer:**

1 There are various platforms where our young are educated on civic-mindedness and positive social behaviour. In schools, through the Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) curriculum, they learn what it means to be a good and caring neighbour, how they can play their part to keep the environment clean by not littering, and to show consideration for cleaners and fellow students.

2 The National Environment Agency (NEA) has worked with schools to encourage diners in hawker centres to return their trays and used crockery. Under the Clean Tables Campaign launched in February, NEA has been engaging students, including preschoolers, through creative means such as designing posters to promote tray return and organising themselves to wipe down their canteen tables after meals.

3 The Housing and Development Board (HDB) conducts an Outreach to Young and Youth! (OHYAY!) programme which teaches students about being a good neighbour such as keeping the common spaces of residential areas clean and litter-free and cleaning up after one&#39;s pet.

4 We hope that our young will bring these messages to their families. My Ministry will continue to work with stakeholders to reinforce these positive social behaviour amongst our young and build a more gracious society.
