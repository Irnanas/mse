#### Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Projected Increase in Water Demand and Usage to Support "30 by 30" Goal to Raise Local Food Production and Expected Impact on Supply and Cost of Water    
 
**Mr Shawn Huang Wei Zhong:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment in view of the &quot;30 by 30&quot; goal to raise local food production (a) what is the projected increase in water demand and usage to support this goal; and (b) what will be the expected impact on the supply and cost of water.

**Answer:**

1 Under the &#39;30 by 30&#39; goal, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) will work closely with the agri-food industry to grow the capabilities and capacity of the local agri-food sector to sustainably produce a variety of food types to meet 30% of Singapore&#39;s nutritional needs by 2030. Through initiatives such as the Lim Chu Kang Master Plan and $60 million Agri-Food Cluster Transformation (ACT) Fund, SFA supports the growth of the sector to become highly productive, climate-resilient, and resource-efficient.

2 Given our limited natural resources, our agri-food sector will need to be productive and sustainable by tapping on technologies that use less water and energy. For example, Sustenir Agriculture, an indoor vegetable farm, adopts technology that re-circulates water for reuse, thereby allowing it to use 95% less water than a traditional farm. As agri-technologies mature, SFA will regularly review resource estimates, including water demand.

3 PUB works closely with agencies to understand industries&#39; demands for water and ensure that our water infrastructure remains ahead of demand to meet Singapore&#39;s water needs. PUB will continue to improve cost efficiency and ensure that water remains affordable by leveraging more energy-efficient technology and enhancing productivity.
