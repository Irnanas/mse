#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Questions on LED Wreaths by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Dr Tan Wu Meng:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment what responsibilities and precautions are required of funeral services providers so as to (i) avoid power trips and/or short circuits especially when electricity supplies at common areas are being used and (ii) ensure electrical safety, including the safety of passersby, when LED wreaths are deployed, particularly in situations where the LED wreath is exposed to the elements including rainfall and water.

**Dr Tan Wu Meng:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether there is any requirement for LED wreaths' electrical components to be water-resistant or waterproof, when the LED wreath may be deployed at a location where it may be exposed to rainfall.

**Combined Answer:**

1 The National Environment Agency (NEA) has worked with the Association of Funeral Directors Singapore to develop guidelines for the funeral services industry and premises owners on the usage of light-emitting wreaths at funeral wakes to address potential public disamenities and safety concerns. The guidelines can be found on NEA’s website. 

2 Under the guidelines, any persons or companies who deploy or install light-emitting wreaths shall be responsible for the safe use of these wreaths at funeral wakes, and must obtain the Town Councils’ or relevant authorities’ written permission for the use of these wreaths and associated electrical installation works at public spaces. Where generators are used, a supply installation licence is required, and generator providers and funeral services providers must engage a licensed electrical worker to ensure that the electrical circuitry and connections are done safely.

3 In addition, under the guidelines, the deployment of light-emitting wreaths shall be confined to the funeral wake area and is subject to approvals from Town Councils or relevant authorities. Funeral services providers and companies shall only deploy not more than 10 light-emitting wreaths at each funeral wake area. They should not obstruct the designated pedestrian walkways and pavements, to not affect the passageway of pedestrians on foot or in a wheelchair. They should also not obstruct any fire safety provisions or be placed within 5 metres from any fire hydrant. 

4 NEA will continue to work with stakeholders to implement the guidelines at funeral wakes to ensure a safe environment for all.
