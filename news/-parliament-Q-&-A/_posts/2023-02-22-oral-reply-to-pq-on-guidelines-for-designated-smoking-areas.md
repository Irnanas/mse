#### Oral Reply to Parliamentary Question on Guidelines for Designated Smoking Areas by Dr Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment

**Ms Yeo Wan Ling:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what are the guidelines given to premises owners in the marking out of Designated Smoking Areas within Orchard Road No Smoking Zones; and (b) whether, in the past year, there have been complaints from users on the clarity of these markings.

**Answer:**

1 The National Environment Agency (NEA) has published guidelines on the setting up of Designated Smoking Areas (DSAs) on its website. Under the guidelines, premises owners are to ensure that DSA boundaries must be clearly defined using floor stickers or other forms of permanent marking.

2 In the past year, NEA received one instance of feedback regarding the clarity of markings demarcating a DSA within the Orchard Road No Smoking Zone. NEA has since conducted checks on the condition of all DSAs within the No Smoking Zone and engaged premises owners to make any necessary rectifications. NEA will continue to conduct regular checks and engage premises owners, if necessary, to rectify any non-conformity with the guidelines.
