#### Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Enforcement against Foreign-registered Vehicles for Idling Engines


**Question** :

**\*2227. Mr Murali Pillai:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) why does NEA currently limit the taking of action under the Environmental Protection and Management (Vehicular Emissions) Regulations (&quot;Regulations&quot;) against drivers of foreign-registered vehicles only in circumstances where NEA officers had personally issued infringement notices to these drivers; and (b) what steps can be taken by NEA to establish the identity of, and take action against, drivers of foreign-registered vehicles reported by third parties to have parked with idling engines in contravention of the Regulations.

**Answer:**

1. The Environmental Protection and Management (Vehicular Emissions) Regulations cover a range of vehicular emissions-related offences, including the use of noisy or smoky vehicles, and the idling of vehicle engines.

2. The National Environment Agency (NEA) takes enforcement action against drivers of vehicles found to have contravened the Regulations. When a member of public reports an alleged infringement by a foreign-registered vehicle, NEA is unable to contact the vehicle owner to trace the identity of the driver because unlike local vehicles, we do not have information on the ownership of foreign-registered vehicles. As a result, enforcement action against foreign-registered vehicles must be taken in person by NEA officers, to clearly identify the errant drivers.

3. Nonetheless, when NEA receives feedback from members of public on vehicles that contravene the Regulations, checks will be stepped up at the reported areas and enforcement action will be taken against errant drivers. NEA also regularly patrols hotspots and areas with recurring feedback.
