#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Questions on Smart Meters by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Question:**

**\*2947. Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment with regard to the Smart Water Meter Programme (a) whether there are similar plans for the programme to be implemented for electric metering; and (b) what are the ways to expedite the rollout of the programme to assist residents to save on their utility bills and to provide greater insights for residents to reduce consumption in support of the SG Green Plan.

**Answer:**

1 The Smart Water Meter Programme is being rolled out progressively across Singapore. A Smart Water Meter records volume of water used and transmits the data remotely to PUB daily via digital communications network, thus removing the need for manual readings. Such data would enable PUB to better optimise water demand management and customers to better track and manage their water usage habits. Under the first phase of the programme, PUB commenced the installation of smart water meters in Tampines Central since January this year. Some 3,000 households now have access to daily and hourly water consumption data through the _MySmartWaterMeter_ customer portal, which also provides residents with suspected leak alerts and useful water-saving tips to help them reduce their water bills.

2 The global shortage of microchips has led to some delay in the rolling out of smart water meters. Nevertheless, PUB still aims to install about 300,000 smart water meters in Bukit Batok, Hougang, Jurong West, Tuas, Tampines, and Tengah by next year under the first phase of the programme.

3 PUB is concurrently preparing for the next phase of the Smart Water Meter Programme to install smart water meters in the rest of Singapore. PUB will review the rollout of the first phase, build up its capabilities and expertise, and take into account advances in technology before implementing smart water meters for the rest of Singapore.
