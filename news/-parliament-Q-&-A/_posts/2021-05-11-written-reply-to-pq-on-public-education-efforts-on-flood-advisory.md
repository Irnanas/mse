**Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Flood Advisory**

**Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether the Ministry will consider providing real-time flooding advisories on flood prone roads so that drivers and public transportation can be diverted in case of floods happening.

**Answer:**

1.	PUB has developed an SMS alert system using its island-wide network of over 300 water level sensors to provide the public with early warning of rising water levels in waterways and drains. CCTVs have also been installed at flood-prone areas and hotspots to remotely monitor real-time road conditions in these areas. The information, which has been made available since 2011, is accessible on PUB’s Managing Flash Floods website. Members of the public can subscribe to the SMS alert system and get timely updates on the flood situation from PUB’ social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter.

2.	During heavy storms, PUB also works closely with LTA and Traffic Police to monitor road conditions and notify motorists of flooded roads to avoid through electronic road signages, online and social media platforms and radio broadcasts. 

3.	Since March 2021, all real-time information and updates on floods have been consolidated and made available on the “MyENV” mobile app. We encourage members of public to download the app to stay updated and safe, as Singapore is expected to experience more frequent and intense rainfalls due to climate change.
