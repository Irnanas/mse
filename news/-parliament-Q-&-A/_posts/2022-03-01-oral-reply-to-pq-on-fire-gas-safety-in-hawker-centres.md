#### Oral Reply by Dr Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Fire and Gas Safety in Hawker Centres

**Ms Joan Pereira:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what preventive measures are there to reduce the number of fire and gas leakage cases in hawker and food centres; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider installing gas, smoke or fire detectors in these centres.

**Answer:**

1 Fire safety and gas supply in our hawker centres are subject to the Singapore Civil Defence Force&#39;s (SCDF) prevailing regulations and Fire Code requirements. Hawker centres are installed with fire safety provisions such as manual fire alarms, heat/smoke detectors, fire extinguishers and fire hose reels.

2 SCDF&#39;s Fire Code requires liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders within the allowable capacity, to be stored at ground level outside the hawker centre, at a well-ventilated area where any potential gas leakage can be safely and rapidly dispersed.To help prevent gas leakage and minimise fire risk, the LPG manifold systems have to be designed by a Qualified Person and approved by SCDF. Regular safety checks and pressure leak tests are also required. Similarly, the installation and use of piped Town Gas is regulated by the Energy Market Authority (EMA), and regular checks and maintenance must be carried out by a Licensed Gas Worker (LGW).

3 The National Environment Agency (NEA) and SCDF have also been issuing regular advisories to stallholders on how to exercise personal responsibility in preventing stall fires. We urge all stallholders to stay vigilant and do their part by maintaining good fire safety practices.
