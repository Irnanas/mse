#### Oral Reply to Parliamentary Question on Tray and Crockery Return Rate by Dr Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment

**Ms Joan Pereira:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether the Tray and Crockery Return Rate under the mandatory tray return policy has been maintained at 90% and above since the last update in September 2022; and (b) whether there continues to be regular checks being conducted so as to ensure overall cleanliness is maintained in hawker centres, coffeeshops and food courts.

**Answer:**

1 To date, the average Tray and Crockery Return Rate (TCRR) at hawker centres, coffeeshops and food courts is around 90%.

2 To ensure the cleanliness of our public dining spaces, the National Environment Agency and Singapore Food Agency have been conducting checks, with focus on premises where the TCRR is lower. The average TCRR of around 90% largely shows that many diners have been doing their part. We hope that more diners will return their trays and used crockery, to entrench this as a social norm in Singapore.
