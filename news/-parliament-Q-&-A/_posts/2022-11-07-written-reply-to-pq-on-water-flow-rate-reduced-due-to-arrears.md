#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on the Reduced Water Flow Rate due to Arrears by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Chua Kheng Wee Lewis:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) over the last five years, what is the average number of households whose water flow rate has been reduced due to arrears in utilities payments; and (b) what is the average duration for such a reduced water flow rate before the normal flow rate is restored.

**Answer:**

1 On average, about 6,500 households had their water flow rate reduced due to arrears in utilities payments annually between 2017 and 2021. This is less than 0.5% of the total number of households in Singapore. The median duration in the past five years for such a reduced water flow rate is two days. The normal flow rate is restored once the arrears are cleared or when payment arrangement has been made with SP Services.
