#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Idling Engines by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether the offence for leaving vehicle engines idling applies to electric vehicles, which have no tailpipe emissions.

**Answer:**

1 Under Regulation 21 of the Environmental Protection and Management (Vehicular Emissions) Regulations, it is an offence for the driver not to stop the engine of the vehicle when it is stationary for reasons other than traffic conditions. Since the electric motor(s) of an electric vehicle would stop when it is stationary, Regulation 21 would not apply.
