**Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Public Education Efforts on Usage of Single-use Plastic Bags**

**Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether the Government will start public education efforts in all four official languages on why Singaporeans should reduce the usage of single use plastic bags so that everyone will have a better and aligned understanding of why all should do so.

**Answer:**

1. The Government customises public education efforts and messages based on the target audience. This involves varying the language, content and communication platforms so that we can get the message across. 

2. Since 2019, the National Environment Agency (NEA) has been running the “Say YES to Waste Less” campaign.  The nation-wide campaign is aimed at increasing public awareness on why we should reduce excessive consumption of disposables, particularly disposable carrier bags and containers, and outlines the simple actions we can take. Our efforts cover all disposables, whether they are made of plastic, paper, or degradable materials, since all disposables have an impact on the environment. 

3. The campaign leverages mass media broadcast channels such as television, digital and social media, as well as out-of-home and print advertisements, in order to reach different segments of the population. For example, we included vernacular content on free-to-air channels, print media for the general population, bite-sized interactive content on social media which target the youth, and digital panel ads at HDB lift lobbies for consumers closer to home. In addition, 95 industry partners operating more than 2,100 retail premises have partnered NEA to provide visual reminders to shoppers at points-of-sale. Campaign materials are produced in all four official languages and include posters, educational videos, as well as visual reminders at points-of-sale.
