#### Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Summons for Failure to Wear Face Masks 

**Mr Lim Biow Chuan:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) to date, how many summons have been issued for failure to wear face masks; and (b) what actions can be taken to encourage members of the public to wear face masks to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus.

**Answer:**

1 Since mask wearing was made mandatory in April 2020, more than 2,300 fines have been issued for failure to wear masks.

2 Wearing of masks with good filtration capability helps to reduce the expulsion and transmission of droplets, which is the predominant route of transmission of COVID-19.  Everyone should put on their masks when outside their homes, except when eating, drinking or undertaking strenuous exercise.  Those walking at a normal pace are required to wear a mask.  

3 Government agencies deploy Safe Distancing Ambassadors and Enforcement Officers daily to advise and enforce compliance with Safe Management Measures, including wearing of masks.  Agencies require business owners to ensure that patrons at their premises comply with these measures.  We also reach out through various channels, including newspapers and social media, to encourage the public to observe SMMs and wear their masks so as to keep Singapore safe.
