#### Oral Reply to Parliamentary Question on Secondhand Smoke by Dr Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether the Ministry is aware of and has reviewed studies conducted by other countries which have found that people exposed to secondhand smoke are more likely to be suffering from depression, anxiety, stress, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and dementia; and (b) if so, whether the Ministry will review policies on tackling secondhand smoke at homes in light of these studies.

**Answer:**

1 The Ministry of Health (MOH) regularly reviews the evidence surrounding tobacco control policy and is continually enhancing its efforts to further reduce the prevalence of smoking in Singapore, through public education, provision of smoking cessation services, legislation, and taxation.

2 As previously explained in this House, the National Environment Agency (NEA) is constantly looking out for reasonable and practical solutions to further strengthen our efforts to address the harms of second-hand tobacco smoke. Smokers should also exercise social responsibility, by refraining from lighting up in places where the second-hand tobacco smoke can affect those around them, including their families and loved ones, in order to protect their health.
