#### Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on high-rise littering captured on surveillance cameras


**Question** :

**1470.**  **Ms Mariam Jaafar:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment in the past year, whether the Ministry has any data on the percentage of cases where the surveillance camera did not detect any instances of high-rise littering or was not able to identify the culprit.

**Answer:**

1. When there is persistent high-rise littering feedback at a block of HDB flats, the National Environment Agency (NEA) will work with the Town Council to first issue advisories to residents in the block. Should the issue persist, surveillance cameras with video analytics will then be deployed.

2. In the last 5 years, on average, high-rise littering incidents would be detected in about 40% of surveillance camera deployments. Of the high-rise littering cases detected by the cameras, the offender could not be identified from our investigations in about 3.5% of cases.
