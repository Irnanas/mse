#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Pollutive Motorcycles by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Ms Mariam Jaafar:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) how many older, more pollutive motorcycles remain in use on Singaporeâ€™s roads; (b) how many of these older motorcycles will not meet the higher emissions standards that will come into effect in April 2023; and (c) whether the Government will consider more incentives to encourage owners to deregister these motorcycles.

**Answer:**

1 To reduce air pollution, we announced in 2018 that motorcycles registered before 1 July 2003 will have to meet tightened in-use emission standards from 6 April 2023. Since 2018, the National Environment Agency has offered owners of these motorcycles an incentive of up to $3,500 if they deregister their motorcycles before 6 April 2023.

2 From April 2018 to January 2023, 23,328 older motorcycles were de-registered, with 4,490 still in use. Based on recent inspection data, we expect one in five of these motorcycles will not be able to meet the tightened in-use emission standards.
