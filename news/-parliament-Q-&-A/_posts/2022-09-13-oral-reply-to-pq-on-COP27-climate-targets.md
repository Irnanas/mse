#### Oral Reply to Parliamentary Question on Climate Targets for COP27 by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what are Singapore's climate targets that will be announced at the UN Climate Change Conference 2022 (COP27) in November 2022; and (b) whether the Ministry have held consultations with civil society on the climate targets to be announced and, if so, what are they.

**Answer:**

1 As announced at Budget 2022, Singapore will raise our climate ambition to achieve net zero emissions by or around mid-century. We are also reviewing our 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution (or NDC). Under the Singapore Green Plan 2030, we have been consulting closely with industry and citizen stakeholder groups, including more than 1,200 youths and civil society representatives from green groups and NGOs, through various engagement sessions.

2 Building on these efforts, the National Climate Change Secretariat has launched an online public consultation on Singapore's climate ambition via REACH. Members of the public are invited to contribute views on their vision for a low-carbon Singapore, and how the Government, businesses, communities and citizens can work towards it.

3 We are taking into consideration the views received from these ongoing consultations as we finalise our climate targets later this year.
