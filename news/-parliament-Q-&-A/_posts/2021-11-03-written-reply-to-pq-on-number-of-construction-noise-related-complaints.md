#### Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Number of Construction Noise-related Complaints    
 
**Ms Mariam Jaafar:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether the Ministry tracks the number of construction noise-related complaints; (b) if so, what is the number of construction noise-related complaints that have been received from Woodlands residents each month over the past year; and (c) what are the measures being taken to mitigate the noise in the short term and the long term, including the use of more technologically advanced construction techniques.

**Answer:**

1 From October 2020 to September 2021, the National Environment Agency (NEA) received an average of 23 construction noise-related complaints each month from residents in Woodlands.

2 NEA adopts an outcome-based approach in regulating construction noise. Construction sites must adhere to the regulatory noise limits, and noise meters are installed at the nearest affected premises to monitor compliance.

3 Under the no-work rule, construction work on Sundays and public holidays is prohibited at sites located within 150 metres of any hospital, home for the aged sick or residential building. From 1 October 2022, contractors that have contravened the no-work rule will be required to install electronic video surveillance systems to ensure compliance and deter further violations.

4 There are incentives to encourage the construction industry to adopt quieter construction equipment and methods, such as quieter piling and hacking equipment, noise barriers and enclosures. Since April 2014, NEA has disbursed a total of $8.3 million to help contractors adopt quieter construction equipment and methods.

5 The Building and Construction Authority has been actively championing the adoption of Design for Manufacturing and Assembly technologies, which shifts as much on-site construction activities to off-site prefabrication as possible. Construction becomes faster, cleaner, quieter and of higher quality. Dis-amenities such as noise and dust pollution will be reduced, and construction time can be shortened.
