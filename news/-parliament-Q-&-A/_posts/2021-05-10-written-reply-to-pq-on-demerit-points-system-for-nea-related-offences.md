**Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Demerit Points System for NEA-related Offences**

**Mr Shawn Huang Wei Zhong:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether there are plans to implement a points system that is similar to the Traffic Offence Demerit system for all NEA-related offences such as high-rise littering.

**Answer:**

1.	My Ministry has no plans to implement a demerit points system for all NEA-related offences committed by members of the public such as high-rise littering. We oversee a variety of issues and the penalties tagged to each offence have been calibrated to be commensurate with its severity.
