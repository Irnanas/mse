#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Questions on Proposal to Regulate or Ban Display of LED Wreaths and Similar Items at Funerals by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Questions:**

**Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether the Government will ban the installation and display of LED wreaths, lanterns, balloon arches and similar items at funerals.

**Mr Lim Biow Chuan:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether the Government will regulate the supply of LED wreaths at funeral wakes to ensure that the supplier is responsible for ensuring that the LED wreaths are safe for use with separate power supply.

**Answer:**

1 There has been increasing use of light-emitting wreaths, inflatables and similar items at funeral wakes. If not displayed properly, such items can cause public dis-amenities such as excessive glare to residents and/or pose road safety risks. To address these potential public dis-amenities and safety concerns, the National Environment Agency (NEA) has worked with the Association of Funeral Directors Singapore (AFD) to develop guidelines for the funeral services industry and premises owners on the appropriate placement and display of such items at wakes.

2 Under the guidelines, a maximum of ten light-emitting wreaths, inclusive of one inflatable, conforming to specified dimensions, can be displayed within the funeral wake area between the hours of 7am to 10pm. To ensure compliance, it is the responsibility of funeral services providers and light-emitting wreath suppliers to confirm with the premises owners the number of light-emitting wreaths and inflatables already put up at funeral wakes before taking in any additional orders. Such items should not be placed near fire hydrants, carparks, roads, walkways, and neighbouring business or residential premises. Funeral services providers, light-emitting wreath suppliers and providers of power generators are also responsible for the safe use of these items and must engage licensed electrical workers on the use of generators.

3 NEA and AFD have engaged religious organisations, the funeral services industry and Town Councils on these guidelines. Since the introduction of the guidelines in June 2022, Town Councils have begun to incorporate them into the terms and conditions of their permits for wakes in premises under their management, and some Town Councils have removed light-emitting wreaths and inflatables that do not conform to the guidelines.

4 We will continue to monitor the situation and work with stakeholders to implement the guidelines at funeral wakes to ensure a pleasant and safe environment for all.
