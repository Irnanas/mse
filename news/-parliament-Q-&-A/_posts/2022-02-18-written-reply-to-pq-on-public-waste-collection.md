#### Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Public Waste Collection

**Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment following NEAâ€™s appointment of a new public waste collection contractor from 1 January 2022 (a) what is the cause for the delay in the refuse and recyclables collection in Woodlands, Yishun, Sembawang, Choa Chu Kang, Bukit Panjang and parts of Ang Mo Kio; and (b) what are the steps taken to prevent such delays in the future, especially during a transition to a new contractor.    

**Answer:**

1  ALBA W&H Smart City Pte Ltd (ALBA W&H) took over as the appointed Public Waste Collector for the Woodlands-Yishun sector on 1 January 2022. The initial delays in refuse and recyclables collection in some areas within this sector were due to inadequate manpower and vehicle resources. Supply chain disruptions arising from the COVID-19 situation had also affected the arrival of specialised waste collection vehicles in Singapore.  Moreover, the new collection crew were not yet fully familiar with the collection routes and points. Service quality progressively improved after the first week, as ALBA W&H augmented its fleet and manpower with the support of other service providers and extended its operational hours in the affected areas.    

2  NEA is working to introduce additional safeguards in the licensing conditions so as to ensure smoother transitions in future.
