#### Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on number of high-rise littering cases reported to NEA that remain unsolved  

**Question** :

**\*2156.**  **Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui**: To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) from January to October 2021, what is the number of high-rise littering cases reported to NEA that remain unsolved as the surveillance cameras are unable to capture good vantage points to identify the culprits; and (b) from January 2021 to date, how many of such culprits have been successfully identified through surveillance camera deployment and other methods.

**Question** :

**\*2162.**  **Mr Gan Thiam Poh** : To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment with regard to the high-rise littering cases reported to NEA in the second half of 2021 (a) what is the number of cases that remain unsolved despite the presence of surveillance cameras in the vicinity and other enforcement measures; (b) whether the number of cases has increased as compared to the same period in 2020; and (c) whether the Ministry will be rolling out any new enforcement measures in 2022.

**Answer:**

1. When there is persistent high-rise littering feedback at a block of HDB flats, the National Environment Agency (NEA) will work with the Town Council to first issue advisories to residents. Should the issue persist, surveillance cameras with video analytics will be deployed.

2. From January to October 2021, there was a 20% decrease in high-rise littering feedback received by NEA compared to the same period in 2020. NEA deployed surveillance cameras over 2,200 times at more than 1,400 blocks. Surveillance cameras could not be deployed at 87 blocks due to the lack of suitable vantage points. From the deployments from January to October 2021, close to 2,000 acts of high-rise littering were captured and enforcement action successfully taken against close to 1,000 offenders. About 300 more residential units are currently under investigation.

3. While we have laws to deter high-rise littering, it is also important to shape community norms to deter high-rise littering. Since 2020, NEA has been placing standees displaying information on on-going surveillance or localised statistics on offenders caught at the HDB blocks with persistent littering feedback, to deter such acts. Town Councils also display posters jointly produced by the Municipal Services Office at HDB blocks, highlighting the environmental and social consequences of high-rise littering.
