**Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Mosquito Breeding in Fallen Leaves**

**Mr Lim Biow Chuan**: To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether the public cleaning contractors are required to clear the fallen leaves from trees on a daily basis; and (b) whether additional efforts can be made to clear the leaves so that there will not be mosquito breeding grounds in the fallen leaves.

**Answer:**

1 The cleaning frequency of public areas by public cleaning contractors ranges from daily to once every three days, based on the cleaning needs of individual areas. Heavy leaf shedding takes place in Singapore during the months of February to March and June to July and cleaning frequency is increased during these months to clear the higher volume of fallen leaves.

2 The National Environment Agency (NEA) tracks the performance of the public cleaning contractors to ensure that service standards are maintained. Town Councils also engage pest control operators to inspect and remove potential mosquito breeding habitats.
