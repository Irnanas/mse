#### Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Smoking Cabins or Rooms at HDB Void Decks

**Miss Rachel Ong:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether smoking cabins or rooms at HDB void decks or next to the flats can be provided as an alternative for smokers in light of the increased work-from-home arrangements; and (b) what new measures are being taken to reduce incidences of secondhand smoke in HDB flats given the continuing rise in incidences despite earlier measures taken.

**Answer:**

1.  Under the Smoking (Prohibition in Certain Places) Regulations, smoking is prohibited at HDB void decks and common areas such as corridors and staircases. Smoking facilities such as smoking cabins or rooms are also not permitted at these locations. 

2.	We are mindful that smoking facilities at these locations may result in void decks and common areas becoming congregation points for smokers and affecting residents adversely. Moreover, the proliferation of smoking facilities at void decks and common areas may inadvertently normalise smoking and give our young the impression that smoking is an acceptable habit.
 
3.	We are aware of community-driven efforts to set up designated smoking points at residential areas. As of now, these are not pervasive and their effectiveness is still to be determined. Based on the National Environment Agency’s (NEA) recent observations of the trial at Nee Soon South constituency, the presence of designated smoking points has not reduced public feedback on smoking. Nevertheless, we will continue to monitor and support such community-driven effort, and share best practices with other Advisors.

4.	To reduce the incidence of secondhand tobacco smoke in HDB flats, NEA works with government agencies, Town Councils and community leaders to display visual reminders to remind smokers to be considerate and not smoke in prohibited areas, such as the common areas of HDB blocks. Where feedback on unlawful smoking persists, NEA will step up surveillance and enforcement operations at the affected block.

5.	The issue of smoking in homes affecting neighbouring units has been discussed in this House previously. The Government is working with the community to adopt a three-pronged approach: (a) engender greater social responsibility, (b) facilitate productive conversations between neighbours and (c) enhance the dispute resolution process to better address disputes arising from smoking in homes. For example, NEA has collaborated with the Housing Development Board (HDB), Health Promotion Board (HPB), Municipal Services Office (MSO), and Town Councils to develop and issue joint advisories to units where feedback on secondhand tobacco smoke is received. The advisory urges smokers to be considerate to their family members and neighbours, as well as advises them on the smoking cessation helplines available. We will also continue to encourage and support ground-up efforts by community organisations and the grassroots to manage feedback on smoking in homes. In addition, NEA, as part of an inter-agency committee, is working with other agencies to study how community disputes including secondhand tobacco smoke in homes can be better addressed under the Community Dispute Management Framework through upstream measures to encourage mediation and conflict resolution between neighbours.

6.	There are also cessation programmes available across healthcare institutions, workplaces and in the community, to support smokers in quitting the habit. For example, HPB’s ‘I Quit 28-day Countdown Programme’ encourages participants to take daily actions to remain tobacco-free and rewards participants who quit successfully. Smokers can call QuitLine (1800 438 2000) to receive customised smoking cessation counselling from Certified Quit Smoking Consultants or visit HealthHub for articles, tips and support. HPB is also leveraging digital platforms during COVID-19 to pilot online delivery of programmes such as smoking cessation talks at workplaces, and will continue to ensure easy access to smoking cessation programmes.

7.	While we will continue to monitor and refine our strategies, mitigating secondhand tobacco smoke in HDB flats ultimately requires everyone to play their part. We urge smokers to abide by the smoking prohibition, and strive to quit the smoking habit for the benefit of their own health, their loved ones, and the community.
