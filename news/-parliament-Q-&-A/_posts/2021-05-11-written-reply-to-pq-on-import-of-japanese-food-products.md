**Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Import of Japanese Food Products**

**Mr Leong Mun Wai:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether new rules on the import of Japanese food products will be put in place in light of the Japanese Government’s plans to release contaminated water from the Fukushima nuclear accident into the ocean.

**Answer:**

1. SFA adopts a science-based risk assessment and management approach towards food safety and sets food safety standards that are consistent with international standards. Food imported into Singapore are subjected to our surveillance and sampling regime to ensure food safety. All food imports, including imports from Japan, must comply with SFA’s food safety requirements. 

2. SFA will continue to conduct food safety assessments, monitor Japanese food imports, and take guidance from international standards as well as international agencies such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to ensure that Japanese food imports comply with our food safety requirements. In the event that food products fail SFA’s inspections and tests, they will not be allowed for sale and will be returned to the country of origin. 

3. We strongly encourage Japan to continue working closely with the IAEA and the international community. We hope Japan will adopt an open and transparent approach and share its detailed plans and data collected with the international community going forward.
