#### Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Tray Returns  

**Ms Joan Pereira: To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment regarding the implementation of tray returns at hawker centres and food courts, (a) what guidelines are in place to ensure that there are sufficient tray return locations at hawker centres and food courts and the accessibility of these stations; and (b) whether there are consultations with hawker and food centre committees to determine appropriate numbers and proper siting of these stations.**

**Answer:**

1.	The National Environment Agency (NEA) works with Hawkers’ Associations and Town Councils to ensure adequate provision and appropriate siting of tray and crockery return racks in hawker centres, taking into account factors such as the visibility of the racks and the availability of accessible locations to install them. As part of the Clean Tables Campaign, NEA is installing 75 more tray and crockery return racks at hawker centres, on top of the 900 existing racks, and improving the table-cleaning workflow. This is done in consultation with key stakeholders, including Hawkers’ Associations, hawkers, as well as cleaning companies and cleaners. The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) and NEA are also engaging food court and coffee shop operators to install tray and crockery return infrastructure at visible locations, and to improve their table-cleaning workflow. 

2.	All of us have to play our part to keep our public dining spaces clean and safe. Returning our dirty trays and crockery after meals will enable cleaners to focus on cleaning and sanitising tables. This will allow for a cleaner and more hygienic dining environment and better protect us against COVID-19 and public health risks.
