#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Emissions of Reportable Facilities by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what is the current number of reportable facilities that are required to submit an emissions report; (b) what percentage of emissions in Singapore do the reportable facilities contribute to; and (c) whether the percentage of emissions contributed by reportable facilities are increasing or decreasing.

**Answer:**

1 The Carbon Pricing Act 2018 requires business facilities with annual emissions between 2,000 and 25,000 tonnes to register as reportable facilities. Currently, there are 81 reportable facilities. The percentage of Singapore’s emissions contributed by these facilities has remained steady at about 1%. In comparison, taxable facilities with annual emissions exceeding 25,000 tonnes account for about 80% of Singapore’s emissions.
