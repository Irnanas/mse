#### Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Tuas South Desalination Plant

**Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what is the current operational situation at Tuaspring Desalination Plant after PUB’s takeover; (b) how much additional capital outlay will be necessary to bring Tuaspring Desalination Plant to optimal operating capacity; and (c) whether PUB has decided to operate the Tuaspring Desalination Plant over the long term.

**Answer:**

1.	PUB has been operating the Tuaspring Desalination Plant, now renamed as Tuas South Desalination Plant, since taking it over in May 2019. While the plant is capable of producing water, PUB has been doing repair work in order to address operational issues. The repairs, which included the replacement of ultra-filtration and reverse osmosis membranes, cost around $80mil in total and are on track for completion in mid-2021. 

2.	PUB will continue to operate the Tuas South Desalination Plant to safeguard Singapore’s water security.
