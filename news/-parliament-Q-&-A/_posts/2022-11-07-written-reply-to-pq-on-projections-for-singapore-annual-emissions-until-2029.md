#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Projections for Singapore's Annual Emissions until 2029 by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Ms He Ting Ru:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment given the recent announcements about the 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution, what are the year-on-year projections for Singaporeâ€™s annual emissions from now until 2029.

**Answer:**

1 Given our limited abatement options, Singapore relies on international collaboration and emerging technologies, such as electricity imports and carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) to reduce its emissions. Given their nascency, we do not have year-on-year projections from now to 2029.
