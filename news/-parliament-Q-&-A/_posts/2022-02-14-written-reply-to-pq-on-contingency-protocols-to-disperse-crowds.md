#### Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Contingency Protocols to Disperse Crowds

**Dr Shahira Abdullah:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether the Ministry will consider stricter and swifter contingency protocols to disperse crowds during these COVID-19 prevalent times in order to avoid spontaneous potential superspreader events.

**Answer:**

1 Agencies typically plan ahead and increase deployment of Safe Distancing Ambassadors (SDAs) and Enforcement Officers (EOs) during festive periods or major events. Agencies also step up enforcement checks around specific hotspots. While agencies pro-actively work with stakeholders to plan the necessary safe management arrangements, it is not possible to prevent crowds from forming spontaneously. When unforeseen crowding takes place and agencies are alerted, SDAs and EOs will respond to the site and act to disperse the crowds. Where circumstances require, the Police will be brought in. 

2 Everyone must continue to do their part to be socially responsible. Agencies will continue to take firm enforcement action, including prosecution, against individuals and groups who do not comply with safe management measures.
