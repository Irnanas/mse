#### Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Active Recycling Points

**Ms Hany Soh:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) how many active recycling collection points have been set up across Singapore; and (b) how many have been set up in community centres to educate and bond residents to build a green community.

**Answer:**

1.  There are currently over 90,000 recycling collection points across Singapore. These include recycling bins in residential and non-residential premises, Cash-for-Trash stations, “Recycle N Save” reverse vending machines (RVMs) for beverage containers and electronic waste recycling points voluntarily offered by industry stakeholders. The locations of the Cash-for-Trash stations, RVMs and electronic waste recycling points are available on the National Environment Agency’s (NEA) website.

2.	The recycling collection points include recycling bins, Cash-for-Trash station, RVM and electronic waste recycling points in selected Community Clubs (CCs). The Public Waste Collectors appointed by NEA will also offer recycling bins at no charge to all CCs upon request. Various ground-up programmes and initiatives, such as eco interest groups, regular recycling drives and sustainability-related activities by grassroots organisations will further encourage recycling among residents. 

3.	My Ministry and NEA will continue to work closely with all stakeholders to raise public awareness on recycling and make it convenient for Singaporeans to do their part for the environment.
