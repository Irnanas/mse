#### Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Fishery Ports and Food Security


**Question** :

**1396. Mr Leon Perera:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what is the risk assessment in terms of impact on food security with regard to the impending closure of Senoko Fishery Port; and (b) what measures are planned in case of future disruptions to fish sourcing operations at Jurong Fishery Port.

**Answer:**

1. In June 2020, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) announced plans to close the Senoko Fishery Port (SFP) by 2023. Consolidation with Jurong Fishery Port (JFP) would allow trade buyers to purchase wholesale seafood conveniently at a single location.

2. COVID-19 has brought to fore the importance of building further resilience in our supply chains. During the two-week temporary closure of JFP in July 2021, SFA and Enterprise Singapore (ESG) responded quickly to facilitate distributors and supermarkets to activate alternative arrangements. A small number of traders switched to SFP for their supply and some sourced from alternative suppliers. We also had sufficient stocks of frozen seafood. The combination of measures allowed our supply of fish and seafood to remain stable.

3. SFA is reviewing its plans for the fishery ports. SFA&#39;s ongoing consultancy study on the future infrastructure needs to support the fresh food wholesale and distribution in Singapore is expected to be completed in 2022.

4. SFA continues to ensure tight Safe Management Measures at key food supply nodes to enhance the resilience of our wholesale sector, including the fishery ports. We have limited entry to authorised visitors with entry passes, put in place a Rostered Routine Testing Regime for tenants and workers, and have clearly demarcated zones to prevent intermingling of foreign vessel workers and foreign truck drivers with local tenants and workers. SFA has also worked with associations and tenants to fine tune their contingency plans and has made alternative distribution sites available.
