#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Singapore's 30 by 30 Goal by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether the 30-by-30 goal to produce 30% of our local nutritional needs locally takes into account whether the food is grown based on locally- sourced raw materials including feed and fertilisers.

**Answer:**

1 The agri-inputs required for the ‘30 by 30’ goal, such as feed, fish fry, seeds and fertilizer, will need to be sourced both locally and overseas. Given Singapore’s limited land and other resources, it will not be feasible or commercially viable to locally produce all agri-inputs required by our farms. For business continuity, our farms will need to ensure their agri-inputs come from diversified sources. Our farms also hold some buffer stock of their key agri-inputs for supply chain resilience.
