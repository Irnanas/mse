#### Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on NEA's Toilet Improvement Programme  

**Ms Hany Soh:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) to date, how many coffee shops and hawker centres have signed up for NEA&#39;s Toilet Improvement Programme since its launch on 2 October 2020; and (b) whether NEA is looking into reviewing the existing scheme to encourage more stakeholders to come on board and increase its participation rate.

**Answer:**

1 The Toilet Improvement Programme offers co-funding for coffeeshop owners or operators, and Town Councils, to improve toilet designs, install sanitary fittings and adopt technology that better facilitate the cleaning and maintenance of toilets in coffeeshops and hawker centres. As of 31 August 2021, NEA has received applications from 38 eligible coffeeshops and 10 hawker centres.

2 To increase participation, NEA reaches out to stakeholders regularly through circulars and engagement sessions. I welcome Members to encourage your Town Council and the coffeeshop owners or operators in your constituency to apply for funding under the Toilet Improvement Programme.
