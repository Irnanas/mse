#### Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Smoking in Casinos

**Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether the Ministry will consider banning smoking in casinos; and (b) what measures are in place to safeguard the health of people working in the areas of the casinos where smoking is allowed.

**Answer:**

1 Both casinos in Singapore have implemented smoking restrictions as part of their house rules. Smoking and non-smoking gaming areas in the casinos are separated. Measures are taken to mitigate the potential impact of second-hand tobacco smoke, such as maintaining negative air pressure in smoking gaming areas to prevent second-hand tobacco smoke from drifting into non-smoking areas; improving exhaust air flow rates to reduce accumulation of smoke; and the installation of ionisers within the casinos. The casinos also inform potential hires that they will be working in a smoking environment.

2 We will continue to review the smoking prohibition regulations from time to time.
