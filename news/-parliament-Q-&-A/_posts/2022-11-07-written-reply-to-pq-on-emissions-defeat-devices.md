#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Emissions Defeat Devices by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Dr Tan Wu Meng:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether agencies have assessed the prevalence of the use of emissions defeat devices, whereby such devices allow vehicles to bypass existing emissions standards; and (b) what is the regulatory approach towards such devices, their installation and use. 

**Answer:**

1 The National Environment Agency (NEA) takes a serious view of defeat devices that allow vehicles to override the exhaust treatment system and bypass the control of pollutant emissions. NEA has been working with Government agencies, vehicle manufacturers and inspection centres to monitor the prevalence of such devices. 

2 We will take firm enforcement action to address the use of defeat devices, including against vehicle owners who knowingly use defeat devices to mislead, conceal or deceive the Government of their vehiclesâ€™ actual exhaust emissions.
