#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Climate-Friendly Households Programme by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Murali Pillai:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment out of the 300,000 eligible HDB households benefitting from the Climate-Friendly Households (CFH) Programme (a) how many households have utilised the e-vouchers to date, with specific breakdowns for purchases of (i) climate-friendly refrigerators (ii) water efficient shower fittings and (iii) energy-efficient LED lights; and (b) whether the CFH Programme can be extended to the purchase of energy-efficient and climate-friendly air-conditioners, water heaters or washing machines to promote a better take-up rate of the programme.   

**Answer:**

1 More than 65,700 or 20% of households eligible for the Climate-Friendly Households (CFH) Programme have registered for the e-vouchers as of August 2021. About 14,000 vouchers have been utilised so far, of which 6,600 were for the purchase of energy-efficient refrigerators, 5,200 for LED lights, and 2,200 for water-efficient shower fittings. The vouchers are valid till 31 December 2023 so that households may choose to use them only when their appliances are due for replacement.    

2 There is currently no plan to extend the programme to cover other types of appliances, as the programme is intended to help lower-income households take climate action while saving money and is targeted at essential household appliances. We will continue to monitor the take-up rate of the vouchers and review the programme at an appropriate juncture. Meanwhile, NEA and PUB have been working with community partners to conduct outreach efforts to residents on the programme.
