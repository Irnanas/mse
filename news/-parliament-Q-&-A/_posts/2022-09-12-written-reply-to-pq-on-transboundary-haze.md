#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Transboundary Haze by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Ng Ling Ling:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment given the Singapore Institute of International Affairs' Haze Outlook report dated 15 June 2022, assessing that there is a medium risk of severe transboundary haze this year (a) what will the Ministry do to mitigate the risk of severe transboundary haze; and (b) how does it intend to continue working with its regional counterparts to realise the vision of a haze-free ASEAN.

**Answer:**

1 The Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment and the National Environment Agency (NEA) closely monitor the risk of transboundary haze and take active steps to avoid and mitigate the occurrence of haze.

2 The ASEAN Specialised Meteorological Centre (ASMC), which is hosted by NEA's Meteorological Service Singapore, regularly disseminates its weather and haze outlook, as well as satellite imagery and fire hotspots information, to ASEAN Member States. ASMC also provides early warning of transboundary haze, which serves to alert our neighbouring countries to take active steps to address the problem of transboundary haze at source.

3 We have also formally extended an offer of fire-fighting assistance to Indonesia in June 2022 to augment Indonesia's efforts to address hotspots and fires during the traditional southern ASEAN dry season. We have continually made this offer since 2005.

4 This year, Singapore will host the 17th meeting of the Conference of Parties to the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution. We will be using our chairmanship to strengthen regional commitment and take active steps towards the vision of a haze-free ASEAN.
