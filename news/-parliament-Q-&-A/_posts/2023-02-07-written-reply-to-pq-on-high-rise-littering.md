#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on High-rise Littering by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Dr Tan Wu Meng:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment annually since 2017 (a) how many reports have been received regarding high-rise litter involving faeces; (b) in how many of these cases have the perpetrators identified; and (c) what are the penalties received by the perpetrators.

**Answer:**

1 The National Environment Agency does not track the types of litter involved in high-rise littering cases.

2 High-rise littering offenders, regardless of the litter type, will be charged in Court. They can be fined up to $2,000 for their first conviction, $4,000 for their second conviction and $10,000 for third and subsequent convictions. In addition to the fines, offenders may also be issued a Corrective Work Order which will require them to clean public areas for up to 12 hours.
