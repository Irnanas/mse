#### Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Instances Necessitating Erection of Sound Barriers at Construction Sites in Past Two Years    
 
**Mr Yip Hon Weng:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) in the past two years, what are the instances that have necessitated sound barriers to be erected at construction sites; and (b) whether the Ministry will require sound barriers if a construction site is within 150 metres from noise-sensitive premises and residential buildings and has faced multiple complaints and breaches of permissible noise levels.

**Answer:**

1 The regulations on construction noise under the Environmental Protection and Management Act strike a balance between enabling the development of needed infrastructure and keeping construction noise to a manageable level. The National Environment Agency (NEA) adopts an outcome-based approach by stipulating maximum permissible noise limits, rather than requiring specific measures that may not be suited for every site. This allows contractors to use the most cost-effective methods to meet the regulatory noise limits, including installing perimeter noise barriers. Construction sites closer to residential buildings and noise-sensitive premises would typically require more measures to meet the noise limits.

2 NEA takes strict enforcement action against contractors found to have exceeded the noise limits, which includes a fine of up to $40,000 per offence. NEA will continue to work with the construction industry to study measures to manage construction noise, taking into account international best practices and the local context.
