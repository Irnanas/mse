#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Questions on Anti-Mosquito Paint by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Question:**

**Ms Hany Soh:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether the Ministry has explored the efficacy of anti-Aedes mosquito paint; and (b) if such paint is proven efficient, whether there are plans to encourage more buildings, especially HDB flats undergoing repainting works, to adopt such paint in areas such as common corridors and void decks.

**Answer:**

1 The National Environment Agency has reviewed anti-mosquito paint. The duration of the effectiveness of such paint varies, depending on the active ingredient, the material of the painted surface, and environmental conditions. Its effectiveness can also be hampered by insecticide resistance of the mosquito species. Overall, the effectiveness of anti-mosquito paint against dengue has not been proven and there is currently no scientific data to support its widespread use for dengue control.
