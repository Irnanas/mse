#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Singapore’s 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment following the review of Singapore’s 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) (a) whether the achievement of the NDC and climate targets will be tied to individual Ministry’s KPIs and senior management performance bonuses; (b) if so, how is this implemented; and (c) if not, why not.

**Answer:**

1 The performance bonuses of senior management in the public sector are not tied to climate targets. Key government outcomes, including our national greenhouse gas emissions, are reported annually in the Revenue and Expenditure Estimates (Budget Book) and progress is reported biennially in the Singapore Public Sector Outcomes Review. The Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change, chaired by Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean, also tracks the progress towards Singapore’s national climate targets.
