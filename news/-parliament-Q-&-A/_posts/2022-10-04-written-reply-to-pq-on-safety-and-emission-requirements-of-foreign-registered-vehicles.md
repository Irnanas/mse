#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Safety and Emission Requirements of Foreign-registered Vehicles by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Leon Perera:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) how and to what extent does the Government work with its Malaysian counterparts to highlight to drivers of foreign-registered vehicles entering Singapore that they must comply with safety and emission requirements, such as exhaust and noise emission standards under the Environmental Protection and Management (Vehicular Emissions) Regulations; and (b) what enforcement efforts are made to raise compliance rates.

**Answer:**

1 The Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment and the National Environment Agency (NEA) have regular bilateral engagements with our Malaysian counterparts to exchange information on environmental issues of mutual interest, including the control of vehicular emissions, and enforcement efforts in both countries. Notably, the Malaysia-Singapore Expert Group on Vehicular Emissions meet regularly to update each other on vehicular policies which will impact the other, well ahead of implementation. NEA also publicises vehicular policies impacting foreign motorists well ahead of implementation through media channels and posters placed at land entry checkpoints.

2 Foreign vehicles entering Singapore are routinely screened at the land entry checkpoints to ensure that their emissions comply with the requirements under the Environmental Protection and Management (Vehicular Emissions) Regulations. The Land Transport Authority, NEA and Traffic Police also conduct joint enforcement operations along our roads for violation of the emission standards and other vehicular-related offences. Drivers will be offered a composition sum on the spot if their vehicle fails the emissions test. Beyond the composition sum, foreign vehicles emitting excessive smoke can be turned back at the land entry checkpoints.
