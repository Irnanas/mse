#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Energy Efficient Grant for SMEs by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment with regard to the new Energy Efficiency Grant for SMEs (a) what is the Ministry's assessment on the current adequacy for energy efficient accreditation of commercial equipment such as refrigerators; and (b) whether there are plans to expand the scale of accreditation to provide more purchase options for SMEs.

**Answer:**

1 Under the Energy Efficiency Grant, there are pre-approved models in each equipment category, namely, air-conditioners, refrigerators, clothes dryers and LED lighting, that have high energy efficiency ratings under NEA's Mandatory Energy Labelling Scheme. In the case of commercial equipment, where international standards for measuring energy efficiency are not readily available, there are pre-approved models that use technologies considered more energy efficient, for example, inverter technology for commercial refrigerators. By identifying pre-approved models in each equipment category, this will facilitate the application process for companies applying for the Energy Efficiency Grant.

2 We will regularly review the list of pre-approved models of equipment in all the categories and welcome SMEs to suggest other models or technologies, that are of similar or higher levels of energy efficiency to be assessed for inclusion under the Energy Efficiency Grant.
