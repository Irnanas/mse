#### Written reply to Parliamentary Question on Tray Return by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Mohd Fahmi Bin Aliman**: To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment with regard to the implementation of mandatory tray returning at public dining spaces from 1 June 2021 (a) how many advisories were issued to diners during the advisory period from 1 June 2021 to 31 August 2021, disaggregated by month; (b) what were the challenges faced by NEA officers during the advisory period; and (c) how are such challenges ameliorated.  

**Answer:**

1 During the advisory period from 1 June to 31 August 2021, the National Environment Agency (NEA) issued an average of about 6,000 advisories daily across the 110 hawker centres to remind diners to return their dirty trays, crockery and clear their litter after their meals. Enforcement action was not taken during this advisory period.   

2 The majority of diners were cooperative and would comply when advised to do so during the advisory period. Nevertheless, NEA enforcement officers occasionally encountered diners who did not heed their advice.  In such cases, the officers would explain to the diners the rationale of the mandatory tray and crockery return policy and urge them to comply with the rules.    

3 Following the end of the advisory period, NEA has started to enforce against table littering in hawker centres from 1 September. For diners who do not clear their dirty trays, crockery and litter, enforcement officers will first advise them to do so. Diners who refuse to heed officersâ€™ advice will have their particulars taken down and be issued written warnings if it is their first offence. Only second and subsequent offenders will be issued fines or be sent to Court. Thus far, diners have largely complied with our advisories and only 1 written warning has been issued since enforcement commenced.
