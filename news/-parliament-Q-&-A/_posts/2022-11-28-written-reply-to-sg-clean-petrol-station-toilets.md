#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on SG Clean in Petrol Station Toilets by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Raj Joshua Thomas:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) how many petrol stations have applied for and been granted the SG Clean certification; and (b) whether there are any initiatives by the Ministry to improve the cleanliness and hygiene of petrol station toilets.

**Answer:**

1 The National Environment Agency (NEA) launched the SG Clean Quality Mark certification in February 2020 to rally businesses to take ownership in maintaining high standards of cleanliness and hygiene on their premises. Premises owners or operators who meet a set of sanitation and hygiene requirements, including enhanced toilet cleaning, can apply for and be awarded the SG Clean Quality Mark certification. To-date, more than 120 retail outlets in petrol stations have been awarded the SG Clean Quality Mark. 

2 NEA will continue to work with various partners such as Restroom Association of Singapore, Singapore Kindness Movement and Public Hygiene Council, to promote the cleanliness of public toilets including those in petrol stations and encourage good toilet etiquette. Under the Environmental Public Health Act and Regulations, cleanliness lapses such as the failure to clean and maintain a public toilet and its sanitary conveniences are subject to enforcement action. We invite petrol station operators to partner NEA in the annual Clean Public Toilets Campaign, which is currently running from November 2022 to February 2023.
