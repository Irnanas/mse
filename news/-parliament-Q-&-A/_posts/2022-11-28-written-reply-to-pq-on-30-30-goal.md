#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on 30 by 30 goal by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Liang Eng Hwa:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment with regard to the progress of the “30 by 30” goal (a) what are the resource constraints faced by food producers; and (b) whether higher energy and other input costs have any impact on the timeline to meet this goal.

**Answer:**

1 Food producers in Singapore face constraints in the availability of land and manpower. They also need to deal with the costs of energy, water, and agri-inputs, such as feed, fry/fingerling and seeds. Due to factors such as geopolitical tensions, rising inflation and inclement weather events, our farms, as with many other businesses, have been facing higher costs associated with energy and agri-inputs. 

2 The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) works closely with our local farms to address these challenges, and we remain committed to working towards our goal of developing the capabilities and capacity to meet 30% of Singapore’s nutritional needs by 2030.
