#### Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Microplastics in Seafood

**Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether the Ministry has done a study on the presence of microplastic in seafood from kelongs in Singapore waters; (b) if so, what are the results of the study; and (c) if not, why not and whether it intends to do so. 

**Answer:**

1.  Microplastics is an emerging global issue for food security and human health. There have been scientific reports of the ubiquity of microplastics across different mediums like the environment, freshwater, plants and animals. For example, microplastics can potentially enter the human food chain if they enter the marine environment and are ingested by marine animals.

2.	Based on currently available evidence, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation and the European Commission have assessed that the overall human health risks posed by microplastics at present is low. 

3. 	Since 2020, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) has been developing the testing methodology for microplastics in food and water as there is currently no international method available. There are also surveys in progress on selected food products to collect baseline data for insights on microplastics levels in food available in the market. The findings from these surveys will be ready in about two yearsâ€™ time. 

4. 	SFA will continue to monitor and keep abreast of international scientific developments on the issue of microplastics, before deciding on the need to conduct specific studies in seafood from local waters. MSE takes the issue of marine pollution seriously and will continue to work with all stakeholders to prevent and reduce marine plastic debris through the management of pollution from land-based sources, and the management of water pollution and quality in inland water bodies and coastal areas.
