#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Semakau Landfill by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Leon Perera:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether there are plans for waste disposal after the Semakau Landfill is fully filled; and (b) what are the projected construction costs and dates of completion of new landfills.

**Answer:**

1 Ongoing efforts are being made to reduce the waste to be sent to Semakau Landfill, thereby extending the lifespan of the Landfill well beyond 2035. Under our Zero Waste Masterplan, we have mapped out a range of initiatives to reduce waste generation and improve recycling rates, to reduce the amount of waste sent to the landfill by 30% per capita per day, by 2030. These include research and development, regulatory measures, as well as outreach and public engagement.

2 My Ministry and the National Environment Agency are assessing the results of these ongoing efforts as well as future plans, and will provide an update when ready.
