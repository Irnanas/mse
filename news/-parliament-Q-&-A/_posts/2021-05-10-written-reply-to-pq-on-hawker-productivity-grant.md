**Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Hawker Productivity Grant**

**Mr Mohd Fahmi Bin Aliman:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment what is the number of hawkers who have benefitted from the Hawkers' Productivity Grant since its inception.

**Answer:**

1.	The National Environmental Agency (NEA) launched the Hawkers’ Productivity Grant (HPG) in October 2017 to co-fund the purchase of kitchen automation equipment by cooked food stallholders, such as food processors and continuous feed vegetable cutters. Such equipment help them in food preparation and save time. In 2020, we expanded the grant to also benefit market stalls. With this expansion, stallholders can also receive co-funding when purchasing service innovation equipment, such as queue management and wireless paging systems. 

2.	Under the HPG, qualifying stallholders can claim for 80% of the equipment cost, up to a total of S$5,000. They can also submit claims for more than one equipment. 

3.	Since its inception, NEA has approved 1,072 applications for the Hawkers’ Productivity Grant. This has benefitted 651 hawkers.
