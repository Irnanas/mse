#### Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Construction Noise Summonses

**Question** :

**\*2306. Dr Tan Wu Meng** :To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) since January 2020, how many summonses for construction site noise exceeding permissible limits are issued; (b) what are the median, 75th and 95th percentile cumulative amount of such fines issued to a single construction site; and (c) how do these fines compare to the total developer profits accruing from the projects at such sites.

**Answer:**

1. From January 2020 to November 2021, 466 notices of composition and summonses were issued to 290 construction sites, less than 6% of the total, for exceeding the permissible noise limits stipulated in the Environmental Protection and Management Act. During the same period, the median, 75th and 95th percentile cumulative summonses issued to owners and/or occupiers of a single construction site for exceeding the noise limits were $10,500, $32,500 and $76,200 respectively. Less than 8% of summonses were issued to repeat offenders. We do not track developer profits from specific construction projects.
