#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on the Impact of Global Developments on the Singapore Green Plan 2030 by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Ang Wei Neng:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether the war in Ukraine, intensifying competition between the United States and China, high global inflation and the threat of global recession have affected the Singapore Green Plan 2030. 

**Answer:**

1 Over the last year, geopolitical tensions including the on-going war in Ukraine have disrupted the supplies of essential items, including energy.  This is compounded by extreme weather patterns such as heatwaves and droughts that have disrupted the energy markets.  Globally, the energy crisis has provided stronger impetus for countries to diversify their energy sources with renewables.  Likewise for Singapore, we are accelerating the deployment of solar energy and sourcing for renewable electricity from the region under the Singapore Green Plan 2030. Investments in clean technologies and enhancements to infrastructure will help us to bolster our energy security and mitigate the impact of climate change. 

2 We remain committed to implementing the Green Plan initiatives and are currently making good progress. For instance, we have increased the installed solar capacity from 125 megawatt-peak in 2016 to 670 megawatt-peak in Q1 2022.  We are on track to meet our 2030 targets of 2 gigawatt-peak of installed solar capacity.  EV adoption is also growing robustly, with electric car registrations for the first 9 months of 2022 exceeding 10% of all new car registrations. Almost half of our new car registrations in 2022 so far are cleaner-energy vehicles, which include hybrids.

3 Global inflation has caused prices of capital goods to rise, including those needed for green transition. We will monitor its impact and work with the industry closely to find solutions.  

4 The Green Plan is a living plan and will continue to evolve, as we engage a diverse range of stakeholders and take into account technological developments and new solutions.
