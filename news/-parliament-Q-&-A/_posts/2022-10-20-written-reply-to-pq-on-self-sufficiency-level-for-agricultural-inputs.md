#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Self-sufficiency Level for Agricultural Inputs by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what is the current self-sufficiency level for agricultural inputs; and (b) whether Singapore will consider setting a target for a level of self-sufficiency on agricultural inputs.

**Answer:**

1 Farms use a wide range of agricultural inputs from diverse sources depending on their farming models. The Singapore Food Agency is currently focused on our ‘30 by 30’ goal, to build up the capabilities and capacity to produce 30% of our nutritional needs by 2030. We have not set any targets for the self-sufficiency of agricultural inputs and it would not be practical to do so at this stage. Given the risk of supply disruptions, all businesses, including farms, should have in place business continuity plans.
