#### Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Separate Recycling Bins

**Mr Christopher de Souza:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether the Ministry will consider piloting separate recycling bins for biodegradable plastics.

**Answer:**

1.  There are no plans to pilot separate recycling bins for biodegradable plastics as the environmental benefits of segregating such plastics do not apply in Singaporeâ€™s context. Unlike in countries where waste is buried directly in landfills, plastic waste generated in Singapore is either recycled or incinerated in waste-to-energy plants. As such, biodegradable plastics are treated in the same manner as non-biodegradable ones in Singapore. Any litter that enters our waterways is also removed using litter traps and flotsam removal craft before it reaches the sea. Therefore, this prevents plastic waste from entering and polluting the ocean.  

2.	We will continue our efforts to reduce and recycle all types of plastic waste, especially single-use plastics.
