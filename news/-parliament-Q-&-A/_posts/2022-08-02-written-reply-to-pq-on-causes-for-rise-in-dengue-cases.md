#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Causes for Rise in Dengue Cases by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Question** :

**Mr Christopher de Souza:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether the rainfall over the past few weeks coupled with the high day-temperatures have increased the risk of contracting dengue and extending the number of clusters.

**Answer:**

1 Multiple factors have contributed to the surge in dengue cases this year, such as the high _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito vector population, and the circulation of the previously uncommon Dengue Virus Serotype 3 (DENV-3) against which population immunity is low. The recent warm and rainy weather is also a contributing factor as higher temperatures could result in the faster development of the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito vector and faster replication of the dengue virus. The rainy weather could also have resulted in the creation of additional mosquito breeding habitats. We therefore urge everyone to take immediate action to suppress the mosquito population by practising the Mozzie Wipeout and conducting regular housekeeping.
