#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Questions on Bids for Hawker Stalls in Toa Payoh by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Question:**

**Mr Saktiandi Supaat:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) from 2019 to 2021, what is the annual ratio of successful tenderers to unsuccessful tenderers for hawker stalls selling cooked food in the Toa Payoh area; (b) what are the mean and median bid prices among such successful tenders; and (c) whether the Government will consider giving incentives or prioritising coffeeshop stallholders who are displaced as a result of increase in rentals.

**Answer:**

1 From 2019 to 2021, the National Environment Agency (NEA) received an average of 13 tender bids per cooked food stall put up for tender/application at hawker centres in Toa Payoh. This subscription rate is similar to the national average of 13.5 across all our hawker centres.

2 The mean and median bid prices among successful tenders for hawker centres in Toa Payoh during this period were $1,323 and $1,417 respectively. Hawkers who have successfully bid for their desired stalls will pay these rentals, which are kept unchanged for the duration of the initial 3-year tenancy period, before having their rental reviewed and adjusted based on independent professional valuation, which may be similar, higher or lower than the tendered rental.

3 Vacant stalls in NEA-managed hawker centres are included in NEA&#39;s monthly stall tender exercises. This tender process ensures that stalls are allocated in a fair, open and transparent manner. The barrier to entry is low as there is no minimum bid price and the stall will be awarded to the highest qualifying bid. Successful bid prices for stalls awarded are also published online as reference to guide prospective hawkers in placing bids. Eligible Singaporeans or Permanent Residents, including coffeeshop stallholders, can participate in the open tender system or apply for vacant stalls at hawker centres operated by NEA-appointed operators.
