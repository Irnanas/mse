#### Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Support for Funeral Expenses


**Question:**

**1400. Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment in view of elevated costs for COVID-19 related funeral expenses, whether the Ministry is exploring providing some additional financial support for bereaved families to offset these costs.

**Answer:**

1. Funeral expenses would vary depending on the desired funeral arrangements for the deceased and preferences of their family. Some additional funeral expenses may be incurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, due to requirements such as Personal Protective Equipment to protect funeral staff who handle the bodies of deceased COVID-19 patients deemed to still be infectious.

2. There are avenues for bereaved families to seek financial support from the public and people sectors. For example, family members may approach Social Service Offices for support for funeral expenses.
