#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Insects for Human Consumption by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment what is the target timeline for (a) allowing the import and sale of insects as food for human consumption; and (b) issuing licences for domestic insect farming for human consumption.

**Answer:**

1 The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) is conducting a public consultation on the regulatory framework for the import, local farming, processing, and sale of insect products for human consumption. The public consultation will end on 4 December 2022. SFA will consider the feedback and announce details when ready. This would also depend on industry readiness to meet the regulatory requirements and consumersâ€™ acceptance for such products.
