**Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Noise Emitted by F&B operators**

**Ms Tin Pei Ling:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether the Ministry will consider setting a limit on noise emitted by food and beverage operators located in residential areas.

**Answer:**

1 It is not meaningful to implement fixed limits on noise emitted from food and beverage (F&amp;B) establishments as it would be challenging to pinpoint the exact source of the noise. There could be multiple sources contributing to the noise in the vicinity, such as operations-related activities, patrons, other establishments sited in close proximity as well as surrounding activities.

2 Guidelines have been established on best practices for noise mitigation at F&amp;B establishments, such as restricting noise-generating activities and ensuring equipment is maintained in good working condition. The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) and relevant agencies will also engage the F&amp;B operators to advise on suitable noise mitigation measures when feedback is received.
