#### Oral Reply by Dr Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on High-rise Littering

**Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment what is the rationale for legislating and making high-rise littering an offence despite the inherent difficulty in enforcement.   

**Answer:**   

1  Littering in public places is an offence under Section 17 of the Environmental Public Health Act 1987. This covers littering in a range of scenarios including high-rise littering. There is no separate legislative provision for high-rise littering.
