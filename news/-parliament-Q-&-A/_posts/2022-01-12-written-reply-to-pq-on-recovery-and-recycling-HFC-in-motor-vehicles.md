#### Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Recovery and Recycling of HFCs in Motor Vehicles


**Questions** :

**\*2386. Mr Murali Pillai:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what measures are put in place to monitor compliance by technicians and mechanics of motor vehicles for the recovery and recycling of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) during vehicle servicing and vehicle disposal; and (b) what enforcement action has been taken against entities or persons flouting these requirements.

**Answer:**

1. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are greenhouse gases that are often used as refrigerants in refrigeration and air-conditioning (RAC) equipment. To reduce HFC emissions and support Singapore&#39;s climate action efforts, the National Environment Agency (NEA) mandates the recovery and proper treatment of spent HFC refrigerants in household refrigerators and air-conditioners, and commercial water-cooled chillers. This requirement does not apply to air-conditioners in motor vehicles, as most vehicles are exported at the end-of-life.

1. NEA is studying the feasibility of extending HFC mitigation measures to other RAC equipment, including those used in motor vehicles. This will be done in close consultation with relevant stakeholders and agencies.
