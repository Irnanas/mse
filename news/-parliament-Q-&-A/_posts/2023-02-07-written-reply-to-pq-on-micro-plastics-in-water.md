#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Micro-plastics in Water by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether the Ministry has tested our national supply in the last year for micro-plastics contamination levels; and (b) if so, whether the test has been conducted for each of the four national tap sources to ascertain if there are any differences in the presence of micro-plastics.

**Answer:**

1 PUB has conducted biennial surveillance of the level of micro-plastics in water from our Four National Taps since 2017. The latest testing results in 2021 showed that micro-plastics were not detected.
