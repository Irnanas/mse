#### Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Bukit Timah Canal


**Question:**

**1352. Mr Christopher de Souza** : To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what has been the progress of improvement works on the Bukit Timah Canal between the Jalan Anak Bukit flyover and Jalan Kampong Chantek; and (b) when is the estimated date of completion of these works.

**Answer:**

1. PUB commenced the drainage improvement work on Bukit Timah Canal between Rifle Range Road (near Jalan Anak Bukit Flyover) and Jalan Kampong Chantek in 2019. As of December 2021, about a quarter of the project is completed. PUB is on track to complete the remaining works by 1Q 2024.

2. PUB has also completed the road raising works for a 450m stretch of Dunearn Road between Sime Darby Centre and Binjai Park in November 2021. This is an interim measure to reduce flood risks at Dunearn Road before the ongoing drainage improvement works are completed in 2024.
