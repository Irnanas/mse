#### Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Stakeholder Engagement for Nationally Determined Contribution Pledges Update


**Question:**

**\*2344. Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether there are any updates to the stakeholder engagement exercises to update Singapore&#39;s Nationally Determined Contribution pledges for the UN Climate Change Conference 2022 (COP27).

**Answer:**

1. Under the Glasgow Climate Pact adopted at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP-26) in Nov 2021, Parties agreed to revisit their 2030 Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDC, by the end of 2022, to achieve greater alignment with the Paris Agreement temperature goals. Singapore will do our part to fulfil our international obligations.

2. The Government is working on our plan to review the NDC in time for COP 27, including stakeholders and community engagement and consultation.
