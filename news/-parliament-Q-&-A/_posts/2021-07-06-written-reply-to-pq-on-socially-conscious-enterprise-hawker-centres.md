#### Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Socially-Conscious Enterprise Hawker Centres

**Mr Leon Perera:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) from 2016 to 2020, what is the annual number of cooked food stalls at social enterprise hawker centres (SEHCs); (b) what are the annual numbers of newly registered hawker stalls and stall closures at (i) SEHCs and (ii) non-SEHC hawker centres; and (c) whether there have been any substantive changes in the monthly rate of newly registered hawker stalls and stall closures in the first six months of 2021.

**Answer:**

1 In 2016, there were 110 cooked food stalls at 3 Socially-conscious Enterprise Hawker Centres (SEHCs). This increased to 274 cooked food stalls by 2018, when 4 more SEHCs became operational. 

2 From 2016 to 2020, there was an average of 20 terminations of tenancies and 59 new entrants per year in SEHCs.  In non-SEHC centres, there was an average of 301 terminations of tenancies and 315 new entrants per year. Overall, the average occupancy rates of hawker stalls have remained high at both SEHCs and non-SEHCs, above 90%.

3 In the first six months of 2021, we observed a lower monthly turnover of stalls in hawker centres compared to previous years.
