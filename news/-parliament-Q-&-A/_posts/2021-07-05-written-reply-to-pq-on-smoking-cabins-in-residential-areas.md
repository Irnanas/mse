Condominiumsâ€™ management corporations, or MCSTs, can carry out improvements to the common property, and enact by-laws to manage the development, including for the deployment of smoking cabins in non-smoking prohibited areas within the development, subject to the relevant provisions under the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act.
