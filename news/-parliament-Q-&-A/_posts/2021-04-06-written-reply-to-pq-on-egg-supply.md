#### Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Egg Supply

**Mr Leon Perera** : To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) to what extent the recalls for eggs from Malaysian farms have had an impact on egg supply and prices in Singapore; (b) how does the Ministry intend to deter profiteering; and (c) how is the Ministry working with the Malaysian authorities to ensure egg supplies from Malaysia remain safe for consumption.

**Answer:**

The two recalls of eggs detected with _Salmonella Enteritidis_ (SE), on 12 Mar 2021 and 19 Mar 2021, have had minimal impact to Singapore&#39;s egg supply. In total, the two affected Malaysian farms account for only 5% of our egg supply. Egg importers have been able to switch to other SFA-accredited farms to make up for the shortfall.

2 There is no indication that the recalls have affected egg prices in Singapore or given rise to acts of profiteering. Average retail egg prices in Singapore have remained stable over the past month.

3 SFA has notified the Malaysian authorities of the SE detections and is working with them on the investigations. SFA will assess the investigation findings and measures put in place at the affected farms to ensure that they are satisfactory, before the suspensions can be lifted for the farms to resume their export of eggs to Singapore.

4 The occurrences of food safety issues from time to time demonstrate the importance of diversifying our food supply sources. Other than Malaysia, our egg supply comprises those produced locally, as well as those imported from countries including Thailand, Ukraine, Poland, and others. SFA will continue to accredit egg farms which plan to export to Singapore, to ensure that they have good farm management practices and strong biosecurity measures in place to prevent the risks of SE contamination.
