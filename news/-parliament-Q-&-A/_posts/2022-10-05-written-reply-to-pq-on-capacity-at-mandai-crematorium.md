#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Water Conservation Tax Rates by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Dr Tan Wu Meng:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether there is redundancy capacity at Mandai Crematorium to hedge against crematorium downtime.

**Answer:**

1 The Mandai Crematorium managed by the National Environment Agency has sufficient capacity to meet current cremation demand. This includes buffer capacity to allow for regular maintenance of cremators, and to accommodate fluctuations in daily cremation demand. Intermittent higher demand can also be met by extending operation hours to increase the number of cremation slots at Mandai Crematorium. A second crematorium being constructed at Mandai is scheduled to be completed by 2024. This will further enhance our long-term capacity to meet projected demand.
