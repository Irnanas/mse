#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Questions on Cremation Fees by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Question** :

**1842. Ms Joan Pereira:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether the Ministry will consider waiving the cremation fees for individuals on public assistance who passed away and have no family members or friends to attend to their matters upon their death.

**Answer:**

The cost of cremation in government-managed crematoria has been kept affordable at $100 since 1997. For deceased individuals on public assistance without next-of-kin, there are sources of financial support from the public, people and private sectors. For example, the Ministry of Social and Family Development&#39;s Social Service Offices (SSOs) can tap on pro bono services offered by welfare services to assist Comcare beneficiaries who do not have any financial or family support to pay for funeral services, including cremation fees.
