#### Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Urgency of Public Education on Climate Change Imperatives

**Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment following the Government's review of its climate change targets after the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), whether the Government will consider how it can enhance its public education efforts on the urgency of Singapore’s climate change imperatives and goals so that more Singaporeans will have a better understanding and be persuaded to play their part in different ways.   

**Answer:**

1 A climate change public perception survey conducted by the National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) in 2019 found that 90 per cent of Singapore residents are aware of climate change and its impact, while close to 80 per cent are prepared to do more to fight climate change. Under the Singapore Green Plan 2030, we have been focusing our public education and engagement efforts on three fronts: (1) generating greater public awareness on sustainability measures; (2) fostering understanding of new green opportunities and the trade-offs and costs involved; and most importantly, (3) galvanising collective action to combat climate change.     

2 The Green Plan ministries have been holding discussions with the public and key stakeholders on various sustainability topics, including our net-zero emissions ambition. In fact, in the last two weeks, we have held two Green Plan Conversations on the Resilient Future and Sustainable Living pillars. These Conversations aim to increase understanding of climate change impacts and Green Plan initiatives to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Through these Conversations, we seek to garner support and collective action for the Green Plan. Such dialogues to engage various stakeholder groups will continue to be organised.     

3 The Ministry of Education is also actively nurturing our students to learn, practice and contribute to a sustainable Singapore. Environmental sustainability is now integrated into our education institutions — in curriculum, campus infrastructure, institution culture and practices, and ongoing partnerships with the community.    

4 We have also been working with citizens and partners to co-create policies and solutions as well as catalyse ground-up projects. For example, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) convened a Citizens’ Workgroup to co-create solutions to increase demand for local produce, to enhance our food security. One of the Workgroup’s recommendations was to create meals using local produce to increase awareness of their availability, freshness and nutritional value. The Workgroup participants went on to partner SFA, a chef and Thomson Medical to design meals for new mothers using local produce, which are accompanied with educational material. The pilot LoveSGMums Meal project was launched last month. Another example is our collaboration with Mediacorp on the CNA Green Plan to highlight key challenges brought about by climate change, to inspire individuals to go green. The collaboration included a series of public engagement activities and challenges, and a five-part infotainment series which was launched yesterday, on 4 April.    

5 In the coming year, we will continue to rally and mobilise individuals, the community, and businesses to start their own sustainability efforts and to do their parts for the Singapore Green Plan.
