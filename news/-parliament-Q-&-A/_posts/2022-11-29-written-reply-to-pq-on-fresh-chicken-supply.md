#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Fresh Chicken Supply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what is the Ministry's assessment and update on the fresh chicken supply from Malaysia; and (b) when does the Ministry expect imports of fresh chicken to come in from Indonesia.

**Answer:**

1 Live broiler chicken imports from Malaysia have resumed since 11 October 2022 and our overall supply of chicken remains stable. The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) continues to work with the industry to open up new sources of chicken. Indonesia has been approved to export frozen and chilled chicken to Singapore since 30 June 2022 and businesses on both sides are working out the collaboration arrangements.
