#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Vehicle Noise Emission by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Leon Perera:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) in each of the last five years, how many enforcement actions have been taken against motorists for exceeding the noise emission limits; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider trialling the use of acoustic cameras to support enforcement during late-night and early-morning hours where traffic is light and offending motorists are likely to interrupt residentsâ€™ sleep, and they would more likely be detected by such cameras.

**Answer:**

1 Excessive vehicle noise can be caused by a variety of factors, including vehicle design, illegal modifications, poor maintenance and inconsiderate driver behaviour. The National Environment Agency (NEA) sets noise emission standards that new vehicles must adhere to upon registration, as well as in-use noise emission standards to ensure that vehicles plying the roads are regularly serviced, well maintained and do not emit excessive noise.

2 NEA carries out enforcement actions against vehicles that violate the noise emission standards based on feedback.

In the past five years, enforcement actions were taken against 167 vehicles in 2017, 177 vehicles in 2018, 8 vehicles in 2019, 9 vehicles in 2020 and 76 vehicles in 2021.

3 The use of acoustic cameras for monitoring and enforcement requires rigorous testing under local traffic conditions, as the cameras have limited ability in detecting noise violations from individual vehicles accurately and reliably. Nonetheless, NEA continues to explore acoustic cameras and other technologies with a view to trialing them to strengthen enforcement against noisy vehicles.
