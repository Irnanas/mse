#### Oral Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Gastroenteritis incidents 

**Ms Hany Soh:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment in light of recent cases of gastroenteritis in various education institutions (a) what are the findings from the investigations conducted; and (b) what actions have been taken to manage such incidents and prevent them from recurring in future.

**Answer:**

1. Since the start of 2021, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) and the Ministry of Health (MOH) have conducted joint investigations into 27 incidents of Gastroenteritis (GE) outbreaks involving more than 800 people. Of these incidents, 18 were associated with education institutions, with 13 in pre-schools alone. Despite only being four months into the year, this is reaching the level of 2019, when 18 out of 33 GE incidents in education institutions occurred in pre-schools.

2. GE is the inflammation of the stomach and intestines, characterised by vomiting and diarrhoea, and can be commonly caused by pathogens such as viruses, bacteria and parasites. Viral GE can be transmitted from person to person or through surfaces contaminated by an infected person’s vomitus or faeces. GE can also be spread through contaminated food and water.  

3. The joint investigations by SFA and MOH seek to identify the source and cause of contamination, as well as the corrective measures to be taken. The outcome of the investigations depends on factors such as whether patients seek medical help and testing and whether the source is still present during investigations.

4. For the recent incidents at education institutions, investigations suggest that poor housekeeping practices in schools and lapses in cleaning including within schools’ in-house kitchens could have contributed to the GE outbreaks. For instance, ineffective cleaning agents were used to sanitise areas contaminated with vomitus and faeces. Chopping boards and knives for raw meat and cooked food were also found kept together instead of separately, thus increasing the risk for cross-contamination.  

5. Government agencies including MOH, the Ministry of Education (MOE), the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) and SFA, are working closely to adopt a multi-pronged approach to reduce GE incidents in education institutions. We are particularly concerned about pre-schools, given that young children are more vulnerable. 

6. We undertake measures such as issuing guidelines and advisories on environmental hygiene and good food safety practices and health screening of staff and students. We also brief teachers, food handlers and cleaners on good cleaning practices, personal hygiene and food safety practices. SFA will enhance the food safety training framework for food handlers to better equip them with the knowledge and skills to ensure food safety. 

7. Later this year, we will implement the environmental sanitation regime for premises such as pre-schools under the Environmental Public Health Act. Premises managers and their appointed environmental control coordinators will have to develop and implement an environmental sanitation programme at their premises in accordance with sector-specific standards. These efforts will strengthen environmental hygiene to help reduce the spread of diseases including GE.  

8. It is a collective effort to combat GE outbreaks in our education institutions. Education institutions must play their part to keep their students safe by upkeeping high standards of environmental and personal hygiene, and food safety at all times. Parents and caregivers should also keep their sick children at home until they recover, so as to facilitate a healthy and safe environment for all students.
