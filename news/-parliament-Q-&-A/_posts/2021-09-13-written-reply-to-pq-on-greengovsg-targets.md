#### Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on GreenGov.SG's Targets  

**Ms He Ting Ru:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether the Ministry will release public figures on Singapore&#39;s existing carbon emissions that GreenGov.SG&#39;s projections and targets are based on.

**Answer:**

1 GreenGov.SG was launched in July 2021 with new sustainability targets and significantly expanded coverage of public sector facilities beyond office buildings. The Government will work towards releasing a GreenGov.SG report on the public sector&#39;s sustainability performance in due course, which will include carbon emissions.
