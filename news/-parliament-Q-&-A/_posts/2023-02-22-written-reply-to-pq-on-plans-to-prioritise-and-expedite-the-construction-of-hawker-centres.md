#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Plans to Prioritise and Expedite the Construction of Hawker Centres by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether there are plans to prioritise and expedite the construction of hawker centres in constituencies where there is no hawker centre.

**Answer:**

1 The Government had in 2011 and 2015 announced plans to build 20 new hawker centres in total. The sites of new hawker centres are selected after careful consideration of residential catchments, availability of comparable options and complementary facilities in the vicinity, and compatibility with adjacent land use. This is to ensure that the hawker centre serves the demand of residents in the vicinity while avoiding over competition among comparable F&B establishments.

2 11 new centres have since been opened, with the latest being Bukit Canberra Hawker Centre, which was opened in Dec 2022. The remaining nine new hawker centres will be located within integrated developments, which are at various stages of planning, design development and construction. The completion and opening of these nine hawker centres depend on the progress of the integrated developments. The National Environment Agency (NEA) will continue to work closely with the lead agencies of the integrated developments and the agencies in-charge of other co-located facilities towards completing the hawker centres in a timely manner.
