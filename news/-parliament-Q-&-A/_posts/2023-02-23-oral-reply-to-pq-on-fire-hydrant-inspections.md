#### Oral Reply to Parliamentary Question on Fire Hydrant Inspections by Mr Baey Yam Keng, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what does PUB check for during fire hydrant inspections; (b) what is the frequency of such inspections; (c) whether PUB can consider increasing the frequency of such inspections; and (d) what are the differences in the respective checks carried out by SCDF and PUB.

**Answer:**

1 PUB and SCDF conduct periodic checks on all public fire hydrants in Singapore. For PUB, these are done as part of the broader inspection and maintenance regime for the entire water supply network, which takes around four years to complete. These checks complement SCDF’s annual serviceability tests on all public fire hydrants in Singapore.

2 During PUB’s checks, each hydrant is inspected to ensure there are no obstructions that could impede its operation, and for signs of corrosion or leaks. PUB also removes the hydrant’s valve pit cover to check that the valve pit is clear of debris.

3 During SCDF’s annual serviceability tests on fire hydrants, SCDF performs functional checks on the fire hydrant, including the removal of the hydrant’s valve pit cover followed by the measurement of its water flow and pressure. When defects are found through these tests, SCDF will alert PUB and PUB will take prompt action to rectify them.

4 The current frequency of checks by PUB and SCDF is sufficient to ensure that our fire hydrants continue to function effectively.
