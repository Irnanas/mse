#### Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Measures to Avoid Deterioration in Residential Waste Disposal Methods

**Dr Shahira Abdullah:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment given the move to reduce the use of plastic bags in Singapore, what measures or safeguards will be put in place to avoid any deterioration in residential waste disposal methods.

**Answer:**

1 In Singapore, our residents do need disposable bags for bagging rubbish to ensure public hygiene. This will prevent pest infestation in our bins and chutes. The proposed bag charge will not remove the publicâ€™s access to disposable bags.  Disposable bags will still be available from supermarkets, including those for the bagging of fresh produce such as fish and meat, as well as from other non-supermarket retail outlets and wet markets. 

2 The intent of a disposable carrier bag charge at supermarkets is to discourage excessive use, which is unsustainable as it uses up resources and adds to carbon emissions when incinerated in our waste-to-energy plants. We hope that the bag charge will encourage people to be more mindful of how they consume disposable carrier bags and build environmentally friendly habits.
