#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Home-based Private Dining Businesses in Singapore by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment  

**Mr Sitoh Yih Pin:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether the Ministry tracks the number of home-based private dining businesses in Singapore; (b) if so, what is the current number; (c) whether the Singapore Food Agency expects the number of such businesses to increase in the future; (d) whether the Ministry sees a need to regulate such businesses as food retail establishments to safeguard public health; and (e) if not, what are the reasons.

**Answer:**

1 Home-based private dining businesses are permitted to operate under the Housing and Development Board’s (HDB) and Urban Redevelopment Authority’s (URA) home-based business schemes, for residents living in HDB and private residential premises respectively.

2 The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) takes a risk-based approach in regulating food businesses. As home-based food businesses, including those offering private dining services, are small-scale and the associated food safety risks are low, SFA does not require them to be licensed. SFA also does not track the number of home-based private dining businesses in Singapore.

3 While there is no requirement to be licensed, all home-based food businesses, including home-based private dining businesses, are still subject to the regulations under the Environmental Public Health Act and the Sale of Food Act. They are required to ensure that the food they sell is prepared in a manner that is safe for human consumption.

4 While we do not expect the number of home-based private dining businesses to increase substantially, SFA will continue to monitor the industry and periodically review the regulatory requirements for home-based private dining businesses.
