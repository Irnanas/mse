#### Oral Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Progressive Wage Model Compliance and Efforts to Transform the Cleaning Industry  

**Dr Wan Rizal:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what is the number of licensed cleaning businesses that have failed to comply with the Progressive Wage Model since its implementation in 2014; (b) what actions have been taken against these companies; and (c) what efforts are taken to professionalise the cleaning industry and promote good practices to transform the industry.

**Answer:**

1. Since the introduction of the Progressive Wage Model until 31 May 2021, the National Environment Agency has imposed financial penalties against 57 licensed cleaning businesses and issued warning letters to 52 cleaning businesses for failing to comply with requirements under the Progressive Wage Model, such as failure to pay eligible cleaners bonuses or progressive wages.

2. Under the Environmental Services Industry Transformation Map, strategies and initiatives have been developed to professionalise the cleaning workforce through the adoption of technology, upskilling of cleaners and improving procurement practices. These will help to build a professional, skilled, and manpower-lean cleaning workforce, and drive the adoption of good practices within the industry.
