#### Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on NEA's Investigation on Transboundary Haze in 2015  

**Mr Murali Pillai:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether he can provide an update on NEA&#39;s investigation under the Transboundary Haze Pollution Act 2014 against several companies and individuals for allegedly causing peatland and forest fires in Indonesia causing haze pollution in Singapore in 2015.

**Answer:**

1 In its investigation into fires which caused severe transboundary haze in 2015, the National Environment Agency (NEA) identified fires on concession lands associated with six Indonesian companies and issued legal notices under the Transboundary Haze Pollution Act to all six. As previously announced in March 2017, NEA has closed the cases on two companies based on the information they provided in response to the legal notice. Investigations into the other four companies remain open.
