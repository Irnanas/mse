#### Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Surveillance Cameras

**Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what is the average monthly number of surveillance cameras with video analytics that are currently deployed; (b) what is the length of time for each deployment; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider increasing the number of such surveillance cameras to detect and deter high-rise littering and bird feeding

**Answer:**

1.  The National Environment Agency (NEA) currently deploys an average of 220 surveillance cameras with video analytics each month, with the length of deployment lasting between 5 to 14 days. NEA has increased its high-rise littering camera deployments by over 50 percent in 2020 as compared to 2019, including deployments to detect high-rise bird feeding. 

2.	Even as NEA steps up enforcement against high-rise littering through the use of surveillance cameras with video analytics, we must continue to cultivate social graciousness, good habits, and a sense of collective responsibility to keep Singapore clean and safe. For this reason, NEA adopts complementary strategies such as strengthening community partnerships to raise awareness on the negative impacts of high-rise littering.
