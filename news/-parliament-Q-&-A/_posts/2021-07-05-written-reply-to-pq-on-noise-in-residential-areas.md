#### Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Noise in Residential Areas  

**Mr Seah Kian Peng:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether the Ministry will review the permissible noise levels in residential areas given the rise in home-based learning and more people working from home.

**Answer:**

1. There are multiple and diverse sources contributing to the noise experienced in residential areas, such as human activities, construction, traffic, or a combination of these. Given the difficulties in identifying the exact source contributing to the overall noise level, it is challenging to set limits on the overall noise level in residential areas.

2. To address noise disamenity arising from community sources, such as neighbouring housing units, animals, or activities occurring in common areas, various government agencies have been encouraging community-based solutions and fostering good neighbourliness. There are ongoing initiatives to promote considerate behaviour and tolerance, build strong community bonds, and facilitate community intervention through grassroots leaders and community mediation services. Agencies have also continued public education efforts to encourage neighbourliness, to help residents be aware of actions that may cause nuisance to others, such as excessive noise.
