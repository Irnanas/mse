#### Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Condominiums with By-laws Prohibiting Smoking at Balconies, Patios or Windows and Effectiveness of Them Curbing Problem of Secondhand Smoke    
 
**Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) how many condominiums currently have by-laws prohibiting smoking at balconies, patios or windows; (b) what are the names of these condominiums; and (c) whether the Government has studied whether these by-laws have been effective at curbing the problem of secondhand smoke.

**Answer:**

1 Management Corporations of strata-titled condominiums (MCSTs) have autonomy to enact by-laws to manage and administer use and enjoyment of their developments by residents, subject to relevant provisions under the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act. We do not track by-laws enacted by MCSTs that prohibit smoking.
