#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Lim Chu Kang Agri-Food Cluster by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Question** :

**Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment regarding the holistic master planning of the 390-hectare Lim Chu Kang area into a high-tech agri-food cluster (a) how many existing farms have been identified to be part of the cluster; (b) what are the criteria for selecting farms for the cluster; and (c) whether there are plans to include conventional soil-based or organic farming into the cluster.

**Answer:**

1 As part of our &quot;30 by 30&quot; vision to strengthen Singapore&#39;s food security, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) embarked on a holistic exercise to master plan the Lim Chu Kang (LCK) region. The vision is for the LCK region to become a high-tech agri-food cluster that can raise production in a sustainable and resource-efficient manner. Both existing farms and new interested parties can bid for new plots when they are released. This will take place after the master planning and land development stages.

2 SFA is agnostic to the farming method used. To achieve our &quot;30 by 30&quot; vision with the scarce land available, we would select farm proposals for the new LCK agri-food cluster taking into account their productivity and resource-efficiency.
