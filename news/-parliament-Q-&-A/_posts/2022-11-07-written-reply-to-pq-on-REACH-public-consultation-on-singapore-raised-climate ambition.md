#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on the REACH public consultation on Singapore's Raised Climate Ambition by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) why is the public consultation for Singapore’s Raised Climate Ambition held for three weeks, compared to the public consultation on Developing Singapore’s Long-Term Low-Emissions Strategy which is held for three months in 2019 (2019 Consultation); and (b) whether submissions from participants will be published as an annexure to the responses to feedback and suggestions like how it was previously done in the 2019 Consultation.

**Answer:**

1 The REACH public consultation on Singapore’s Raised Climate Ambition was part of a comprehensive series of engagements that the Government has carried out since April 2022, under the Singapore Green Plan 2030. Through these engagements, we have received feedback and views from more than 1,700 stakeholders. The National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) has published the summary of feedback from these stakeholders, as well as more detailed feedback from the REACH public consultation on Singapore’s Raised Climate Ambition, on its website on 25 October 2022.
