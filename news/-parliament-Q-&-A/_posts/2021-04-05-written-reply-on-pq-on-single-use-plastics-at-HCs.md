**Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Single-Use Plastics at Hawker Centres**

**Mr Christopher de Souza**: To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether a standardized design for recycled takeaway utensils, cutlery and packaging can be mandated to reduce single-use plastic at hawker centres.

**Answer:**

1. There are practical challenges in mandating the use of recyclable cutlery and containers for packaging food. In addition, used cutlery and containers are not recommended for recycling as they are usually contaminated. There is no reason to mandate a standard for recyclable takeaway cutlery and containers at our hawker centres.
