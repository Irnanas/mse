#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Use of Disposable Plastic Cups by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether the Ministry has plans to ban the use of disposable plastic cups by bubble tea shops, coffee joints and fast-food restaurants, similar to Taiwanâ€™s ban implemented with effect from 1 December 2022 aimed at reducing the use of plastic cups nationwide. 

**Answer:**

1 Reusables remain the more environmentally friendly option to conserve our limited resources and reduce waste. All types of disposables, regardless of whether they are made of plastic, paper, or degradable materials, have an impact on the environment during their production, transportation, and disposal.  

2 While we currently do not have plans to ban the use of disposable cups, the National Environment Agency launched a nation-wide Say YES to Waste Less campaign in 2019 to promote the use of reusables. As part of the campaign, many Food & Beverage establishments have taken the lead to offer incentives to customers who bring their own reusable cups or containers. Some F&B establishments also charge customers extra for the use of disposable containers. We encourage the public to use reusable containers when purchasing takeaway food and beverages.
