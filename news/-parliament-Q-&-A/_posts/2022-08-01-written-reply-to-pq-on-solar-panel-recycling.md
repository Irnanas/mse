#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Questions on Efforts and Plans to Tackle Solar Panel Waste and Solar Panel Recycling by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Question:**

**Dr Shahira Abdullah:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment as Singapore ramps up solar energy deployment to meet growing clean energy needs (a) how is Singapore tackling solar panel waste; and (b) what are the future plans regarding solar panel recycling.

**Answer:**

1 The disposal of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels is regulated under the Extended Producer Responsibility scheme for e-waste, wherein companies that supply solar PV panels to the Singapore market are responsible for their end-of-life treatment.

2 These companies are required to provide free take-back services for disused solar PV panels supplied by them and send this waste to licensed e-waste recyclers for recycling. There are currently four licensed e-waste recyclers of solar PV panels in Singapore.

3 We are also actively supporting efforts under NEA&#39;s Closing the Waste Loop research and development programme to build capabilities and develop more sustainable solar PV recycling solutions. For example, one project undertaken by Singapore Polytechnic in collaboration with Sembcorp, seeks to develop an end-to-end pilot demonstration line to recover materials from disused or end-of-life solar panels.

4 We will continue to strengthen our e-waste management capabilities in tandem with solar PV panel deployment, to ensure that solar PV panel waste is properly managed.
