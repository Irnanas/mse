#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on the Best Practice Guide for organising Environmentally-Friendly Events by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Ms He Ting Ru:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment following the recent release of the best practice guide for organising Environmentally-Friendly Events (a) whether all Government-organised or linked Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions (MICE) events will be expected to adhere to the guide; (b) what other concrete steps will be taken to de-carbonise such events; and (c) how will their efforts be measured for success.

**Answer:**

1 The Best Practice Guide for organising Environmentally-Friendly events contains a list of guidelines which all organisations are encouraged to adopt to make their events more environmentally-friendly. 

2 Under GreenGov.SG, the public sector’s environmental sustainability movement, public agencies are required to comply with the practices listed under the ‘Must Do’ section of the guide, where feasible. We will continue to study how to reduce the public sector’s environmental footprint.
