#### Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on the Cleaning of Common Touch Points   

**Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether NEA currently requires management corporations strata titles or their managing agents to clean all common touch points in the immediate vicinity of any positive COVID-19 case; and (b) if it is not currently doing so, whether NEA will consider doing so.

**Answer:**

1 For strata developments such as condominiums with positive COVID-19 cases or visited by such individuals as informed by the Ministry of Health (MOH), the National Environment Agency (NEA) will get in touch with the management corporation strata titles (MCSTs) or managing agents (MAs) to advise them to thoroughly clean and disinfect the premises. This includes all common touchpoints such as door handles, lift buttons, letter boxes, escalators, and railings. The approach taken is similar to that for other premises such as public housing estates and commercial properties. MCSTs and MAs have been responsive in undertaking the disinfection works. Should it be necessary, NEA will work with MOH to compel any persistently uncooperative MCSTs to disinfect their premises through an order under the Infectious Diseases Act.

2 For guidance on how to carry out the cleaning works and the appropriate personal protective equipment to be used, MCSTs and MAs may refer to the &quot;Guidelines for Environmental Cleaning and Disinfection of Areas Exposed to Confirmed Case(s) of COVID-19 in Non-Healthcare Premises&quot; jointly developed by NEA and MOH, which is available on NEA&#39;s website.
