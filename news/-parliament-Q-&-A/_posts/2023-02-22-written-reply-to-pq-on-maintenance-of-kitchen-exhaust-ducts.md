#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Maintenance of Kitchen Exhaust Ducts by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether NEA will consider requiring operators and owners of coffeeshops and hawker stalls to conduct cleaning and maintenance of the kitchen exhaust ducts at least twice a year especially for stalls with heavy cooking.

**Answer:**

1 Under the Environmental Public Health (Food Hygiene) Regulations administered by the Singapore Food Agency (SFA), all foodshop and foodstall operators are required to ensure that kitchen exhaust ducts of their licensed premises are kept clean, properly maintained and in good working order.

2 SFA conducts inspections regularly and takes enforcement action against cases of non-compliance.
