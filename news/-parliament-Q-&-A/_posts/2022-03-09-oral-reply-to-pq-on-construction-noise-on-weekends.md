#### Oral Reply by Mr Desmond Tan, Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Construction Noise on Weekends

**Mr Yip Hon Weng:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment among current ongoing constructions projects (a) how many have been granted permission to work on weekends; and (b) whether there has been an increase of constructions projects granted permission to work on weekends as compared to the last tightening of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions.

**Answer:**

1 Construction works are not allowed on Sundays and public holidays at sites located within 150 metres of any hospital, home for the aged sick, or residential building. Nonetheless, contractors can apply for a permit from the National Environment Agency to carry out specific types of quieter construction works on Sundays and public holidays. These quieter works are subject to a set of conditions, including more stringent noise limits and restricted working hours.

2 In the current Transition Phase to COVID-19 Resilience which began on 22 November 2021, 79 ongoing construction projects have been granted permits to carry out quieter construction works on Sundays and public holidays. In comparison, 70 such permits were granted during the preceding Stabilisation Phase from 27 September 2021 to 21 November 2021.
