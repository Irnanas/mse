#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Profiles of Licensed Plumbers as of June 2022 by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Question:**

**Mr Pritam Singh:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) as of June 2022, how many licensed plumbers are (i) Singaporeans (ii) permanent residents and (iii) foreigners respectively; (b) of those with such a licence who are non-Singaporeans, what are (i) the top ten nationalities and (ii) the type of work pass that they hold respectively; and (c) what are the age profiles of all workers with such a licence.

**Answer:**

1 Licensed plumbers (LPs) form an integral part of Singapore&#39;s water value chain, serving as the touchpoint to customers for their residential and commercial plumbing needs.

2 Out of the more than 950 LPs in Singapore, close to 90% are Singaporeans, some 5% are permanent residents, while the remaining LPs are foreigners. Around 70% of the LPs are above the age of 50.

3 We do not collect information on the nationalities of non-Singaporean LPs. In terms of work passes, the majority of foreigner LPs are S-Pass holders.
