**Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on PRS Operator and Informal Sector**

**Ms He Ting Ru:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment with the introduction of the new electronic waste disposal system on 1 July 2021, what progress has been made with the producer responsibility scheme (PRS) operator to work with informal waste collectors (rag and bone men) in relation to the collection of e-waste.

**Answer:**

1.	Informal waste collectors or rag-and-bone men have a role to play under the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) scheme for e-waste. The National Environment Agency (NEA) requires the Producer Responsibility Scheme (PRS) Operator to develop and operationalise a plan to integrate them into the overall e-waste collection system.   

2.	ALBA was appointed as the PRS Operator in February and is engaging companies that consolidate e-waste collected by informal waste collectors. ALBA will leverage such parties to collect, transport, and sort e-waste, thereby tapping on the informal waste collectorsâ€™ knowledge and network.
