**Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on SG Eco Fund**

**Ms Hany Soh:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment what is the status of the review of the first batch of SG Eco Fund applications which saw an overwhelming interest with over 200 applications received since its launch last year.

**Answer:**

1.	The first SG Eco Fund grant call was open for application from 25 November 2020 to 31 January 2021. We received more than 200 applications from the People, Public and Private (3P) sectors, covering a broad range of topics, such as waste, farming as well as nature and biodiversity.  

2.	The Trust is finalising its evaluation of the proposals. The outcome of the first grant call will be announced later this month and more details will be released then.
