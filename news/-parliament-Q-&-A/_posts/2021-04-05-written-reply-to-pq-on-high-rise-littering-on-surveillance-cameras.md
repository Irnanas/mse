**Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on High-rise Littering Cases Captured on Surveillance Cameras**


**Ms Mariam Jaafar**: To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) for high-rise littering cases captured on surveillance cameras, what percentage did not result in enforcement actions taken due to an inability to identify the culprit; and (b) whether the Government will consider changing the law such that the liability for such cases is automatically assumed to lie with the owner of the unit.

**Answer:**

1. High-rise littering is a serious offence and enforcement action is typically taken, except when there is insufficient evidence. Of the high-rise littering incidents captured on surveillance cameras in 2020, only 1.5% did not result in enforcement actions due to difficulties in identifying the culprit. Nonetheless, the investigation into such cases is time-consuming and does not allow for expeditious resolution. It is also costly to set up high resolution surveillance cameras to pinpoint the specific culprit from the unit.

2. My Ministry will explore the suggestion for a change in law to hold the owner or registered occupier accountable for high-rise littering from their unit, whilst ensuring proper safeguards are in place.
