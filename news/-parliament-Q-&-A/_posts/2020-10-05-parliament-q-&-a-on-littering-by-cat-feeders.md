### Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Littering by Cat Feeders, on 5 October 2020  

**Mr Lim Biow Chuan:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment in the past three years, how many cat feeders have been summoned for littering.  

**Answer:**  

1.	In the past three years, the National Environment Agency (NEA) has enforced against eight cat feeders for littering. Food left behind from the feeding of stray animals may attract pests such as cockroaches and rats, and endanger public health. Containers left behind can also collect stagnant water and lead to mosquito breeding. It is therefore important that cat feeders are considerate and clear leftover food and food containers after feeding.  

2.	Many community cats are taken care of by regular, responsible feeders. NEA and the Animal and Veterinary Service work with the Cat Welfare Society to allow such feeding, while making sure that food remnants are not left behind.
