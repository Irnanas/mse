#### Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Penalty for Littering

**Mr Lim Biow Chuan:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether the Ministry intends to increase the penalty for littering in order to reinforce the message against littering.

**Answer:**

To strengthen the deterrent effect and signal the Governmentâ€™s zero-tolerance for litterbugs, the maximum court fines for littering were last raised in 2014 from $1,000, $2,000 and $5,000 for the first, second, and third or subsequent conviction, to $2,000, $4,000 and $10,000 respectively. Recalcitrant offenders may also be issued a Corrective Work Order (CWO). My Ministry has no plans to increase the penalty for littering for now.
