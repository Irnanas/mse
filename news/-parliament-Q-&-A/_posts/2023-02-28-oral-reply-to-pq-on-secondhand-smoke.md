#### Oral Reply to Parliamentary Question on Secondhand Smoke by Dr Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment in each year since 2019, how many complaints relating to secondhand smoke from neighbours has the Ministry received.

**Answer:**

1 The National Environment Agency received about 400 instances of feedback on smoking in homes in 2019. In 2020 and 2021, the number increased to about 2,000 each year, as more people worked from home during the COVID-19 pandemic. Feedback on smoking in homes has since decreased to about 900 instances in 2022.
