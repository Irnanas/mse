**Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Kigali Amendment**

**Ms He Ting Ru:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether the Ministry has initiated a review of Singapore&#39;s ratification of the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer and, if so, what is the outcome of the review.

**Answer:**

1 The Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol aims to gradually reduce the consumption and production of controlled hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). HFCs are commonly used as refrigerants in refrigeration and air-conditioning (RAC) equipment. When emitted into the environment, some HFCs trap a much larger amount of heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide.

2 Singapore is committed to taking action to control and reduce the use of HFCs with high global warming potential (GWP), as this is in line with our Long-Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy. Since 1 January 2019, HFCs imported into Singapore have been subjected to licensing controls. In 2020, the Climate-friendly Label was introduced to help consumers choose household refrigerators and air-conditioners that use climate-friendly refrigerants. The Grant for Low-GWP Refrigerant Chillers was also introduced to support companies that want to make an early switch to more climate-friendly commercial water-cooled chillers. As HFCs can leak into the atmosphere if RAC equipment is not handled properly, the National Environment Agency (NEA) has launched a training course to train and certify technicians to handle refrigerants properly. Later this year, NEA will mandate the proper recovery, reclamation and destruction of spent refrigerants.

3 My Ministry has initiated a review of Singapore&#39;s ratification of the Kigali Amendment. The decision for Singapore to ratify the Kigali Amendment will be finalised after consultation with key stakeholders. We are working closely with key stakeholders to phase down HFCs and make the transition to climate-friendly alternatives.
