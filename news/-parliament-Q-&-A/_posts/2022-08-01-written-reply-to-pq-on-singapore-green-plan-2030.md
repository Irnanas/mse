#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Singapore Green Plan 2030 by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Question** :

**Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether the Ministry will update the Singapore Green Plan 2030 and climate targets following the outcomes of the World Ocean Summit; (b) if so, what are the updates; and (c) if not, why not.

**Answer:**

1 The World Ocean Summit and UN Ocean Conference held earlier this year called on the international community to scale up actions to collectively protect the ocean and mitigate the impacts of climate change. Our Green Plan already includes many initiatives that contribute to these efforts.

2 At the UN Oceans Conference, Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan outlined our efforts on the shipping front to spearhead the transition towards the supply of environmentally friendly ship fuel. This is part of the Energy Reset pillar of the Singapore Green Plan and also detailed in the Maritime Singapore Decarbonisation Blueprint.

3 Dr Balakrishnan also announced the launch of three environmental research projects, including the Marine Climate Change Science (MCCS) programme. Led by NParks, this $25 million multi-stakeholder research programme will help us better understand the science behind the impact of climate change on our marine ecosystems, such as rising sea levels and increasing sea surface temperatures, so as to inform measures to enhance the resilience of our marine ecosystems. By protecting our natural environment, the MCCS programme contributes to our efforts to transform Singapore into a City in Nature â€“ another key pillar under the Singapore Green Plan.

4 As a living plan, the Singapore Green Plan will be regularly reviewed and updated to take into account the latest available information, international developments and the outcomes of our own research and studies in science and technology, and the progress of the initiatives that we have planned or are implementing.
