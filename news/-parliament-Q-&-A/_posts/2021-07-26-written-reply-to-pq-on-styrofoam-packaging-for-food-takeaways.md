#### Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Styrofoam Packaging for Food Takeaways

**Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether the Ministry will consider banning the use of styrofoam packaging for food takeaways.

**Answer:**

1 We currently have no plans to ban the use of Styrofoam packaging for food takeaways. Styrofoam packaging is of concern in countries where waste is sent directly to landfill, as it is non-biodegradable and remains in the landfill for a long time. In Singapore, all incinerable waste, including Styrofoam packaging, is incinerated safely at waste-to-energy incineration plants fitted with pollution control equipment. 

2 Reusables remain the more environmentally friendly option. We encourage the public to use reusables for food takeaways and avoid excessive consumption of all disposables, including Styrofoam.
