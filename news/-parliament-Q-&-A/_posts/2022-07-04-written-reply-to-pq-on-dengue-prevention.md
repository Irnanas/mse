#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Questions on Dengue Prevention by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Question** :

**\*2966. Ms Poh Li San:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) for each year in the past two years, what proportion of _Aedes_ mosquitoes breeding sites are found at construction sites and how many Stop Work Orders have been issued; (b) how does NEA proactively ensure that construction sites do not become key breeding spots; and (c) besides summons issued to construction contractors for harbouring mosquito breeding, how can these contractors be held responsible for people staying in the dengue cluster who become infected.

**Answer:**

1 In 2020, 2021 and 2022 to-date, about 9%, 8% and 13% of construction sites inspected were found with mosquito breeding respectively. The National Environment Agency (NEA) regularly inspects construction sites as part of its preventive regime. Stringent enforcement action is taken against contractors whose sites are found with mosquito breeding. They may face a fine of up to $20,000, imprisonment for a term of up to 3 months, or both. Repeat offenders face a fine of up to $50,000, imprisonment for a term of up to 6 months, or both. Sites with poor housekeeping and conditions favourable to mosquito breeding may be issued with Stop Work Orders, with the requirement for the site operator to undertake specified remedial measures. These measures have to be implemented and verified by NEA before the Stop Work Orders can be lifted.As of 13 June 2022, 65 Stop Work Orders have been issued to construction sites this year. This is more than the 43 Stop Work Orders issued in the whole of 2021 and the 37 Stop Work Orders issued in 2020.

2 NEA works closely with Singapore Contractors Association Ltd and agencies with significant construction projects such as the Housing and Development Board (HDB) and the Land Transport Authority (LTA), to ensure that the construction industry keeps construction sites free from mosquito breeding.

3 The majority of mosquito breeding sites continue to be found in residential homes, while construction sites contributed less than five per cent of mosquito breeding habitats detected in all premises types in the past two years. Residents should stay vigilant against mosquito breeding in their homes and take measures to protect themselves from mosquito bites. Collective effort by all, including construction contractors, building managers and households, is crucial to prevent further escalation of dengue cases in Singapore.
