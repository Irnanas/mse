#### Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Questions on Safe Distancing Enforcement Officers Executing Searches of Premises  

**Miss Rachel Ong:** To ask the Minister for Home Affairs whether safe distancing enforcement officers executing a search of premises without a warrant are required to wear a body camera at all times during the search.

**Miss Rachel Ong:** To ask the Minister for Home Affairs what protocols are in place for Safe Distancing Enforcement Officers executing searches of premises without a warrant, to clearly identify themselves as authorised Safe Distancing Enforcement Officers, ensure the safety and well-being of occupants who are alone at their place of residence, specifically women, children or the disabled, and avoid abuse of power by such officers.

**Answer:**

1 Safe Distancing Enforcement Officers (EOs) do not randomly or proactively enter residences and check for potential breaches. They adhere to a set of protocols to guide them in deciding whether to enter homes and check for potential breaches, such as if there are repeated or substantiated feedback, or by the presence of tell-tale signs from outside the residence. EOs will engage the occupants and identify themselves with both their EO and corporate staff passes, and explain their intent. For home checks, EOs will be progressively equipped with body worn cameras.
