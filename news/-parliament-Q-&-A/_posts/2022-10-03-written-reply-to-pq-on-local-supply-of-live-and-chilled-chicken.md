#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Local Supply of Live and Chilled Chicken by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Ang Wei Neng:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether an update can be provided on the local supply of live and chilled chicken.

**Answer:**

1 Singaporeâ€™s overall supply volume of chicken is stable. To date, there are 25 countries accredited to export chicken to Singapore. Food businesses and consumers can purchase chilled chicken from countries like Thailand and Australia, and frozen chicken from the United States and Brazil. The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) continues to work with the industry to open up new sources of chicken. One of these new sources is Indonesia, which has been exporting frozen chicken to Singapore since July 2022. Businesses from Indonesia have also expressed interest to export live and chilled chicken to Singapore.

2 While the Government works to minimise the impact of supply disruptions, Singapore will continue to face disruptions in our food supply from time to time, due to external factors. We encourage businesses to review their Business Continuity Plans and to diversify further. This helps the industry to spread out and reduce their risks of supply disruptions. Households and individuals too can contribute to our food resilience by being flexible with our food and ingredient choices, and switching to alternative products or sources when necessary.
