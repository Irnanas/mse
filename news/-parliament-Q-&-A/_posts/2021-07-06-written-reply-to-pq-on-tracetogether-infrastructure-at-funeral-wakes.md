#### Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on TraceTogether Infrastructure at Funeral Wakes

**Ms Joan Pereira:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether the Ministry can help undertakers provide the TraceTogether infrastructure at funeral wakes to spare the families of the deceased from having to personally keep records for those who do not have the TraceTogether app or token, particularly among the elderly.

**Answer:**

1 Since 17 May 2021, TraceTogether-only SafeEntry has been made mandatory at all funeral wakes, as these are higher risk venues, with people coming together for an extended period of time. 

2 The National Environment Agency has worked with the funeral industry to set up SafeEntry Gateway (SEGW) boxes at funeral parlours with wake halls to facilitate SafeEntry check-in. For temporary wake spaces, such as HDB void decks and precinct pavilions, funeral service providers are equipped to provide the required SafeEntry QR code. They can also assist to set up a mobile device with the SafeEntry (Business) app and its SEGW function. The decision to engage funeral service providers for such services lies with the bereaved family.
