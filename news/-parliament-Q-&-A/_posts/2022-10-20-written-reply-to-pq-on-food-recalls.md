#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Food Recalls by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Ms Joan Pereira:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what should consumers do if they have consumed recalled food products; and (b) what recourse do they have if they have taken ill after consumption of the recalled products.

**Answer:**

1 The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) monitors the safety of food sold in Singapore. Food products found to be non-compliant with SFAâ€™s food safety regulations are recalled.

2 Consumers should stop consuming recalled food products. Those who have already consumed the recalled food products should monitor their health and seek medical advice if they fall ill or have any health concerns. Consumers should check with their respective points of purchase on their policies on refunds and reimbursement of medical expenses for illnesses associated with consuming recalled products.
