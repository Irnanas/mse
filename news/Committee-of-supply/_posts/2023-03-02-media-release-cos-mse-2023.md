#### BUILDING OUR GREEN SINGAPORE

_Fostering a liveable, more sustainable nation_

**2 March 2023** – During the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment  (MSE)’s Committee of Supply debates on 2 March 2023, Minister Grace Fu, Senior  Ministers of State Dr Amy Khor and Dr Koh Poh Koon, and Senior Parliamentary Secretary  Baey Yam Keng shared the Ministry’s key initiatives as the Government continues building  Singapore into a green, liveable, and climate-resilient home for all. 

2 Two years ago, the Singapore Green Plan 2030 was launched, charting bold and  concrete policies and actions for Singapore to achieve our net zero emissions goal. This  year, we are pressing ahead in our implementation efforts for Singapore’s green transition.  

**Stewarding Singapore’s transition towards net zero**

_Leading the Transition_

3 The Government is leading the way in Singapore’s decarbonisation journey. Starting in Financial Year (FY) 2023, we will publish an annual GreenGov.SG report  detailing our efforts, progress and plans. From FY2024, all Statutory Boards will also  publish annual environmental sustainability disclosures. 

4 From FY 2024, environmental sustainability considerations will be progressively  introduced into the Government’s tender evaluation process. We will set aside up to 5 per  cent of tender evaluation points for environmental sustainability, starting with large  construction and ICT tenders (see [Annex A](/cos2023/Annex A COS 2023 - Media Release on GreenGovSG.pdf)). 

5 Our government agencies are forging ahead with decarbonising their systems and  processes. PUB, Singapore’s National Water Agency targets to achieve net zero emissions  around 2045, in line with our ambition under GreenGov.SG. Their decarbonisation strategy  is underpinned by 3Rs – Replace, Reduce and Remove (see [Annex B](/cos2023/Annex B COS 2023 - Media Factsheet on PUBs Decarbonisation Strategy.pdf)). 

_Enabling the Transition_

6 Building our green Singapore requires the participation of our partners in  businesses. The Government is further supporting manufacturing companies, including  small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to make their own transitions by enhancing  the Energy Efficiency Fund (E2F). From 1 April 2023, pre-approved energy efficient technologies will be eligible for a fixed 70 per cent support of qualifying costs. The grant  application process will be further simplified (see [Annex C](/cos2023/Annex C COS 2023 - Media Release on Enhanced Energy Efficiency Fund (E2F) - Energy Efficient Technologies.pdf)). 

7 Households can also do their part by switching to more energy efficient appliances  for their homes. The National Environment Agency (NEA)’s Mandatory Energy Labelling  Scheme (MELS) and the Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) has helped  consumers make informed decisions to purchase more energy efficient appliances. We will  be enhancing the schemes to include more appliance types and to raise the efficiency  standards of appliances currently in the schemes (see [Annex D](/cos2023/Annex D COS 2023 - Media Release on MEPS and MELS.pdf)). We will also expand the  Climate Friendly Households Programme to more households. More details will be made  available later. 

**Towards a Zero Waste Nation**

_Facilitating the Transition_

8 Moving towards zero waste supports our net zero goals. Carbon is emitted at  virtually every step of a product’s lifecycle. Therefore, curbing rising consumption and  moving towards resource circularity reduces our carbon footprint. As announced during the  First Reading of the Resource Sustainability (Amendment) Bill earlier this year, a  disposable carrier bag charge at supermarkets will be implemented from 3 July 2023. This  is an important nudge towards changing behaviours and mindsets and incorporating resource consciousness into our daily lives (see [Annex E](/cos2023/Annex E COS 2023 - Media Factsheet on Disposable Carrier Bag Charge.pdf)). Furthermore, to boost the  recycling rate of beverage containers and cultivate recycling habits amongst Singaporeans,  we will be implementing a beverage container return scheme that will apply a fully  refundable deposit to the plastic bottles and metal cans used for pre-packaged beverages. 

9 We also want to help households do their part in increasing our recycling rate. NEA  will be providing a Bloobox to all Singapore households to help them can set up recycling  corners at home and to recycle right. Households will be able to collect their Bloobox from  vending machines across the island later this month. 

**Ensuring water sustainability**

_Securing the Transition_

10 While we strive to mitigate and delay the impacts of climate change, we are working  to ensure that Singapore becomes a climate-resilient nation. A resilient water supply is  critical in safeguarding our water needs from climate change impacts. PUB will continue to  strengthen our water resilience and ensure sustainable water supply for Singapore. We will  redevelop the Kranji Water Reclamation Plant and Kranji NEWater Factory to complete the  three-node Deep Tunnel Sewerage System (DTSS) for water reclamation, increase the  treatment capacity of used water ahead of demand, and bolster our NEWater production to support major upcoming industrial and residential development in the north (see [Annex F](/cos2023/Annex F COS 2023 - Media Factsheet on Redevelopment of Kranji Water Reclamation Plant and NEWater Factory.pdf)). We are also making good progress on DTSS Phase 2, with tunnelling works expected  to complete by the second half of this year. 

11 To improve water efficiency in the non-domestic sector, the Government will  introduce mandatory water recycling requirements on new projects and plant expansions in the wafer fabrication, electronics, and biomedical industries from next year. These industries are water-intensive and have high potential for water recycling (see [Annex G](/cos2023/Annex G COS 2023 - Media Release on New Recycling Requirements.pdf)). 

**Enhancing coastal and flood protection**

12 PUB, which is also our national Coastal Protection Agency, has also been making  steady progress to protect our coastlines. Since May 2021, PUB has launched site-specific studies for several stretches of our coast and will be commencing a study for the Sungei  Kadut and Lim Chu Kang area by mid-year.  

13 To build long-term coastal protection and inland flood management capabilities in  Singapore, the agency will launch a new $125 million Coastal Protection & Flood  Management Research Programme (CFRP). It will drive research and collaboration across  local Institutes of Higher Learning, research institutes and industry. The CFRP will be anchored by a Centre of Excellence, hosted by the National University of Singapore, in  collaboration with other partner institutes (see [Annex H](/cos2023/Annex H COS 2023 - Media Release PUB launches $125 million Coastal Protection and Flood Management Research Programme.pdf)). 

**Securing a supply of safe food**

14 Singapore imports more than 90% of our food supply, making it impossible for us  to insulate ourselves from global food supply and price shocks caused by myriad factors  including climate change. The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) is committed to building our  agri-food sector’s capability and capacity to meet our ‘30 by 30’ goal. SFA will be launching  the first land tender for a wider range of food types, such as fruited vegetables and  mushrooms, in the second half of this year. We are also making good progress in master  planning Lim Chu Kang, to transform the region into a high-tech agri-food zone which can  optimise our limited agriculture space. Following a 6-month stakeholder engagement in  2021, we have appointed a multi-disciplinary team to develop the detailed master plan in  2023 and will continue to co-create with stakeholders as planning progresses. 

15 Our aquaculture sector plays a key role in ensuring our food resilience. To further  support Singapore’s ambitions in leading aquaculture research and innovation, we will  enhance our research and development facilities to attract companies and researchers to  base themselves here. SFA’s Marine Aquaculture Centre, located on St. John’s Island, will  serve as the anchor research campus of the AquaPolis R&D programme. We will also  embark on a pre-planning study to review how our research facilities can be integrated with  other aquaculture infrastructures. (See [Annex I](/cos2023/Annex I COS 2023 - Media Factsheet on Singapore Aquaculture Plan to Uplift Local Aquaculture Sector.pdf))  

16 To support the industry transformation and achieve our vision of a productive and  high-tech agri-food sector, we will continue to develop a skilled agri-food workforce. The Career Conversion Programme for the Agri-tech Sector was launched last year to equip  mid-career professionals with the relevant knowledge and skills. This year, the Institute of  Technical Education (ITE) will offer a Work-Study Diploma in Agriculture & Aquaculture  Technology to equip in-service employees and fresh graduates from ITE Nitec and Higher  Nitec with engineering skills to operate high-tech agriculture and aquaculture systems, and  with knowledge for food crops cultivation and fish farm management (see [Annex J](/cos2023/Annex J COS 2023 - Media Factsheet on Manpower Development Initiatives.pdf)). 

17 To ensure that our local agri-food sector will be commercially viable, there must also  be sufficient demand for local produce. A new Action for Alliance (AfA) on Demand Offtake  and Consumer Education will look into demand and supply aggregation of local produce and build greater mindshare for local produce. The AfA brings together key stakeholders of our local food ecosystem such as farmers, supermarkets, and trade associations (see [Annex K](/cos2023/Annex K COS 2023 - Media Factsheet on Alliance for Action on Demand Offtake and Consumer Education.pdf)). 

**Safeguarding our hawker culture**

18 Our hawker centres are an important institution and a mainstay in our everyday  lives. This year, diners can look forward to the opening of two new hawker centres in  Buangkok and Woodleigh Village, and a refreshed Jurong West Hawker Centre.  

19 The National Environment Agency (NEA) has implemented programmes and  initiatives to support and encourage hawkerpreneurs to join the trade. Through NEA’s  Incubation Stall Programme and Hawkers’ Development Programme, along with similar  programmes by Socially-conscious Enterprise Hawker Centre operators, more than 50 new  hawkers have joined the trade. NEA will continue to review and refine the programmes to  ensure that aspiring hawkers receive the appropriate training. To raise productivity in  hawker centres, centre-level and stall-level productivity grants will both be enhanced. The  Productive Hawker Centres Programme will be enhanced to cover co-funding for Cleaning  Process Automation solutions. NEA will co-fund up to 80% of the deployment costs incurred  by the cleaning service providers for such solutions in hawker centres. Additionally, the  Hawkers' Productivity Grant will be increased from $5,000 to $7,000 and expanded to cover  stall-level digital solutions (see [Annex L](/cos2023/Annex L COS 2023 - Media Factsheet on Hawker Centres.pdf)). 

**Everyone has a part to play**

20 Pursuing the green transition requires a whole-of-nation effort, and the Government  is committed to working with communities and individuals to build our Green Nation. We  have been co-creating activities with our partners through MSE’s annual Climate Action  Week (CAW) to encourage people and communities to take collective climate action  towards a sustainable future for Singapore. This year, we will rebrand CAW to Go Green  SG to rally more people towards a sustainable lifestyle.  

21 Through the SG Eco Fund, we have empowered and supported more individuals  and organisations to drive sustainability initiatives within their communities. Under the  Fund’s third grant call, a total of 77 projects were awarded $2.4 million in funding. Projects  range from experiential environmental education to food rescue to waste upcycling. Since  the launch of the $50 million Fund in 2020, 182 individuals and organisations have been  awarded combined funding of $9 million for their projects (see [Annex M](/cos2023/Annex M COS 2023 - Media Factsheet on SG Eco Fund Third Grant Call.pdf)). 

22 We all have a shared responsibility in achieving our climate goals. Only through our  combined efforts as a nation can we take definitive climate action and build and secure a  green and sustainable Singapore for our future generations. Go Green Singapore.
