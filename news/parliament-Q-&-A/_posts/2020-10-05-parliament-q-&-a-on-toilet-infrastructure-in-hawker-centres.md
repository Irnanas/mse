### Written Reply by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, to Parliamentary Question on Toilet Infrastructure in Hawker Centres, on 5 October 2020  

**Ms Joan Pereira:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment in view of COVID-19, whether screw taps for wash basins and manual flushing systems in hawker centre toilets can be replaced with automatic ones.  

**Answer:**  

1.	The Code of Practice on Environmental Health currently states that public toilets should install sensor-operated taps and flushing systems. All new building developments, including hawker centres, are required to comply with the Code.  

2.	Of the 33 MSE-owned hawker centres, 25 already have sensor-operated taps and flushing systems installed. We will install these provisions in the remaining centres during upcoming periodic renovations. I encourage Town Councils to install sensor-operated taps and flushing systems in HDB-owned hawker centres.  This is particularly important in view of public health concerns amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.  

3.	To support the Town Councils, NEA is providing co-funding under the Toilet Improvement Programme for improved toilet designs that facilitate cleaning and maintenance, including the installation of sensor-operated taps and flushing systems.
