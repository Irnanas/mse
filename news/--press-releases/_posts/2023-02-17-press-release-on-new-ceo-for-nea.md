These included the issuance of the first Green Bond by a statutory board to support the vision of Tuas Nexus as an integrated resource recovery, waste treatment and waste-to-energy facility; the expansion of Project Wolbachia to contain dengue outbreaks; and implementation of tray return as a gracious act and practice of good social responsibility in our public eating places. Within NEA, Mr Goh and his leadership team strove to improve staff well-being and strengthen the culture of teamwork, empathy and resilience. 

4 For his contributions to public service, Mr Goh was awarded the Public Administration Medal (Silver) in 2019 and the Public Administration Medal (Gold) (COVID-19) in 2022.
