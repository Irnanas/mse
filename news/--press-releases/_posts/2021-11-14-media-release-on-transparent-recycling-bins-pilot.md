####  Transparent recycling bins pilot to nudge positive recycling behaviour

Transparent recycling bins pilot to nudge positive recycling behaviour

*Making recycling bins transparent was one of the recommendations from the #RecycleRight Citizens’ Workgroup in 2019*

**Singapore, 14 November 2021** – The Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) and National Environment Agency (NEA) have commenced two pilots to establish whether the use of transparent recycling bin designs can help to encourage the right recycling behaviour. The eight-week-long pilots were launched by Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment Dr Amy Khor during the Hong Kah North Environment Drive 2021 event today. 

2 Two separate pilots, which aim to test whether transparent bin designs have an impact on reducing the contamination rate of recyclables in the blue bins, will run concurrently at selected HDB blocks in Hong Kah North Single Member Constituency and East Coast Group Representative Constituency from 14 November 2021 to 9 January 2022. One pilot will measure the effectiveness of transparent recycling bins versus regular blue recycling bins, while the other pilot will measure the effectiveness of segregated recyclables collection versus comingled recyclables collection. All the recycling bins in the second pilot will be of the transparent type. Please refer to Annex A for more details on the pilots. 

**Transparent recycling bin pilots a follow-up to the #RecycleRight Citizens’ Workgroup**

3 In 2019, MSE convened the #RecycleRight Citizens’ Workgroup, comprising more than 40 individuals from diverse backgrounds to look at how we can improve the way households recycle. The Workgroup presented a report with nine proposals. MSE identified four viable projects to be piloted, including the use of transparent recycling bins to facilitate an intuitive and informed recycling process amongst the public.

4 MSE has since worked with the Workgroup members to refine the pilot’s scope and the bin designs for the project. MSE will also collaborate with non-governmental organisation Zero Waste SG on this project. Zero Waste SG will be involved in the day-to-day management of the pilot and will conduct a survey with residents to evaluate the pilots. Zero Waste SG will release a report on the survey findings when it is ready. 

5 Past surveys conducted by MSE and NEA showed that while six in 10 households recycled regularly, many still lacked knowledge in proper recycling. About 40 per cent of the items deposited inside blue recycling bins cannot be recycled because they are either non-recyclable items or are recyclables that had been soiled by food and liquid waste. It is important to recycle right so that we do not undo the efforts of others who are doing their part for the environment. 

6 SMS Dr Amy Khor said: “The transparent recycling bin pilot is one of the outcomes of the #RecycleRight Citizens’ Workgroup. It seeks to encourage the right recycling behaviour and reduce the contamination rate of the recyclables in the blue bins. The idea is that when people are able to see what is inside the recycling bin, it will deter any improper use of the bin and encourage them to only deposit recyclables into the bins. The pilot will test if the design of the bin would indeed help to change recycling behaviour. This is a good example of how the government can partner the community and tap on their ideas to co-create and co-deliver sustainable solutions for Singapore. Achieving Singapore’s vision of a Zero Waste Nation requires the collective efforts of all stakeholders. We will continue to work closely with Singaporeans to tackle our evolving environmental challenges.”

**Recycling contributes to a circular economy**

7 Recycling is a key enabler of a circular economy, where trash is turned into treasure and waste is reduced. Recycling allows us to close the waste loop and ensures that precious resources are kept in use for as long as possible. This is important for Singapore as our only landfill, the Semakau Landfill, is expected to be filled by 2035 at our current rate of waste generation. Under the Zero Waste Masterplan launched in 2019, we aim to increase our overall recycling rate to 70 per cent and reduce the waste sent to Semakau Landfill by 30 per cent by 2030. Under the Singapore Green Plan 2030 launched earlier this year, we will frontload our efforts to achieve a 20 per cent reduction by 2026. 

**Hong Kah North Environment Drive 2021**

8 Hong Kah North Environment Drive 2021 is a satellite event of Clean & Green Singapore (CGS) 2021. The annual CGS campaign aims to inspire Singaporeans to care for and protect our environment by adopting a clean, green and sustainable lifestyle. This year’s CGS, which will be launched on 21 November, is supported by three key satellite events in the heartlands:

a) 5 Nov - the opening of the Beach Road Estate CleanPod, which forms part of an initiative by the Public Hygiene Council to provide convenient locations to draw litter-picking tools for community clean-ups in residential estates;

b) 6 Nov - the Pasir Ris Park “Kayak N Klean”, a clean-up exercise using kayaks to clear hard-to-reach litter from the Sungei Api Api waterway at the park;

c) 14 Nov - the Hong Kah North Environment Drive 2021, featuring a Facebook live engagement session with residents, with a focus on how to recycle right.

**Details of the transparent recycling bin pilots**

1 MSE and NEA will conduct two concurrent pilots over eight weeks from 14 November 2021 to 9 January 2022 to test different elements of the transparent recycling bins. The pilots will be implemented at eight HDB blocks in Hong Kah North SMC and East Coast GRC (four blocks in each constituency).

2 Pilot A tests whether a **transparent feature** will make a difference in the contamination rate of the bins. It comprises two control bins (no transparent feature) and two experiment bins (with transparent feature). 

3 Pilot B tests whether the **segregation of recyclables** will make a difference in the contamination rate of the bins. It comprises two control bins (co-mingled bins) and two experiment bins (segregated bins).
