**Nine**  **Premises Penalised for Breaching Safe Management Measures**

Six food and beverage (F&amp;B) premises have been ordered to close, while three F&amp;B premises have been issued composition fines for breaches of Safe Management Measures (SMMs). The breaches were uncovered during government agencies&#39; regular checks on F&amp;B premises, malls and other public spaces to ensure compliance with SMMs.

**Six premises ordered to close**

2 Details of the offences committed at the six premises ordered to close are as follows:

1. **Club Mao by Barcode** (#03-04/05 Oriental Plaza) had failed to minimise physical interactions between staff and customers by allowing staff to host groups of customers at different tables on 19 March 2021. The Singapore Tourism Board (STB) has issued an order requiring the operator to close for 30 days from 20 March to 18 April 2021 (both dates inclusive). The establishment was previously ordered to close on 12 December 2020 under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020. Three customers at Club Mao by Barcode were also issued composition fines of $300 each for allegedly failing to keep a 1 metre distance from others when mingling with customers from another group. Further investigations are ongoing for the alleged breaches of SMMs at the establishment.

Ltd** (#04-01 Oriental Plaza),operating under the business name Club Nexus KTV,had failed to minimise physical interactions between staff and customers by allowing staff to host groups of customers across different tables on 19 March 2021.

4 Agencies will continue to step up enforcement checks at F&amp;B premises, parks, malls and other hotspots. Firm enforcement action will be taken against errant operators and individuals. This includes fines, suspension of operations even for first offences, and prosecution for egregious breaches. Even with our vaccination programme underway, and the resumption of more activities, the risks of COVID-19 community transmission remains. It is particularly important to mitigate the risks at F&amp;B establishments through strict compliance with safe distancing and safe management measures, as patrons are unmasked for long periods of time. We urge all members of the public and F&amp;B operators to remain vigilant and to continue adhering to SMMs, even for those who are vaccinated against COVID-19.
