**Four Premises and 77 Individuals Penalised for Breaching Safe Management Measures Since Start of Phase 2 (Heightened Alert);**

**Agencies will Step Up Enforcement Checks at F&amp;B Premises, Parks, HDB Common Areas and Other Hotspots**

While the COVID-19 situation has recently improved, we must continue to remain vigilant to avoid another uptick in cases. We urge members of the public to cooperate with safe distancing personnel and comply with the prevailing safe management measures (SMMs), even as restrictions are eased gradually from 14 June 2021.

2 Since the implementation of Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) on 16 May 2021, government agencies have increased enforcement presence at food and beverage (F&amp;B) premises and identified hotspots, including parks and common areas of HDB estates. Two premises have been ordered to close while two outlets and 77 individuals were issued composition fines for breaching SMMs.

3 Even as we transit to Phase 3 (Heightened Alert) from 14 June 2021, agencies will step up enforcement checks and take firm action against breaches. We seek everyone&#39;s cooperation to remain socially responsible and unwavering in working together to curb the transmission of COVID-19.

**F&amp;B establishments are high risk settings**

4 As announced by the Multi-Ministry Taskforce, dining in at F&amp;B premises, including hawker centres, coffeeshops and restaurants, will be allowed to resume from 21 June 2021. As F&amp;B establishments are high risk settings where COVID-19 transmission has taken place in recent weeks, patrons and operators are reminded to strictly adhere to SMMs. Patrons must keep their masks on at all times, except when eating and drinking.

5 Given that the new variant strains are more transmissible, F&amp;B establishments must ensure that a safe distance of at least 1 metre is maintained between groups of diners to mitigate the risk of transmission â€” the distance is measured between the backs of chairs used by diners, or the legs of chairs if there is no back. F&amp;B establishments should make use of the next week to ensure that SMMs are in place before dining in resumes on 21 June 2021.

6 Agencies will step up enforcement on F&amp;B establishments and take firm action against any breaches, including failure to maintain the 1 metre safe distance between groups and to prevent intermingling of groups, allowing group sizes larger than five persons, serving and allowing the consumption of alcohol after 10.30pm, and providing live entertainment and games. Enforcement actions will include fines, closures even for first offences, and the revoking of Food Shop, Public Entertainment or Liquor Licences.

**Two premises ordered to close**

7 Two premises have been ordered to close due to SMM breaches. The closure orders will take effect when dining-in is allowed to resume.

1. **The STARZ Bistro** (66 East Coast Road, #03-01) allowed customers to dine in on 22 May and consume alcohol after 10.30pm. The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has ordered the establishment to close for 10 days.

1. **Steamov Steamboat Buffet Restaurant** (367/369 Beach Road) allowed customers to dine in on 28 May at 9:30pm. As this is its third offence, URA has ordered the establishment to close for 30 days.

**Fines issued to two outlets for SMM breaches**

8 Two retail outlets were fined $1,000 each for not having staff to oversee the safe entry checkpoints (list of outlets in Annex).

**Enforcement against 77 individuals for SMM breaches at parks and beaches**

9         Since Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) was implemented, 77 individuals have been fined for breaching SMMs in parks managed by the National Parks Board (NParks). These breaches include not wearing masks when not engaging in strenuous exercises, as well as gathering in groups of more than two people. For example, two groups of eight individuals were caught gathering in Changi Beach Park and East Coast Park. In addition, NParks has issued more than 6,000 advisories to individuals for not wearing masks and more than 800 advisories for gathering in groups of more than two people.

10       To ensure that parks remain safe for everyone, NParks will continue to temporarily close access to some parks, and sections of beaches, lawns, and facilities, such as hard courts, shelters and car parks, when these areas get too crowded or where people remain non-compliant with SMMs.

11 Members of the public are advised to check the Safe Distance @ Parks portal (safedistparks.nparks.gov.sg) for the latest updates on visitorship levels before heading to parks. We request all park visitors to be socially responsible and to keep our green spaces safe for everyone. Visitors should observe SMMs such as keeping to allowable group sizes, as well as wearing a mask except when engaging in strenuous exercises or consuming food, drink or medication. The public can refer to the NParks website for the latest advisories for gardens, parks and nature reserves in response to the COVID-19 situation.

**Stepped-up Enforcement by Agencies at Hotspots including Parks and HDB Common Areas**

12 Based on public feedback and ground observations, agencies have identified hotspots where SMMs are more frequently breached. The breaches include not wearing masks when not engaging in strenuous exercises and gathering in groups of more than two persons. These hotspots include parks and common areas of HDB estates such as hardcourts, basketball courts and pavilions. Agencies have stepped up enforcement presence at these locations.

13 Where repeated breaches of SMMs have been observed, agencies will close off facilities to ensure the safety of the community. For example, a group of more than a dozen people were found gathering at a pavilion at Block 90 Pipit Road for dance sessions on several occasions, disregarding SMMs in place. In view of the multiple breaches of the SMMs, the pavilion was cordoned off on 31 May 2021. We therefore urge members of the public to use these facilities responsibly.
