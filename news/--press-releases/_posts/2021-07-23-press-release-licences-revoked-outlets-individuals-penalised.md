**Food Licences Revoked for 3 Pivoted Nightlife Establishments; 22 Outlets and 87 Individuals Penalised for Breaching Safe Management Measures**

_Everyone must comply strictly with Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) restrictions_

Following stepped-up enforcement checks over the past week, three former nightlife establishments which pivoted to food and beverage (F&amp;B) operations have had their food licences permanently revoked by the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) for breaching Safe Management Measures (SMMs) and must cease operations with immediate effect. In addition, 18 F&amp;B outlets were ordered to close, while four F&amp;B outlets and 87 individuals were issued composition fines for SMM breaches.

**Food Licences Revoked for Three Pivoted Nightlife Establishments**

2 Two former nightlife establishments which pivoted to F&amp;B operations had their licences revoked for multiple breaches detected before the mandatory two-week suspension of operations from 16 to 30 July 2021. These included allowing the playing of games within their premises, failing to minimise interaction between staff and customers, and providing hostessing services. The third pivoted nightlife establishment was found to be operating during the mandatory two-week suspension period. All three outlets must cease operations with immediate effect. Details and photos of the offences committed are in **Annex A**.

3 Pivoted nightlife establishments must comply strictly with the ongoing mandatory two-week suspension of operations from 16 to 30 July 2021. The establishments cannot resume operations even after the two-week suspension period, until they pass inspections and receive written approval by SFA. This suspension period will serve to keep our community safe by allowing time for all employees at pivoted nightlife establishments to be tested and for enforcement agencies to conduct checks to ensure that SMM protocols are in place. Any pivoted nightlife establishment found to be operating during the mandatory period of suspension will face firm enforcement action, including prosecution and the permanent cancellation of licences for food, public entertainment and liquor.

**18 F&amp;B Premises Ordered to Close; Fines issued to Four Outlets and Eight Individuals for SMM Breaches**

4 18 F&amp;B premises were ordered to close for breaches such as multiple failures to ensure patrons across tables were seated at least 1 metre apart, allowing groups that exceeded the permitted group size, allowing groups which were not from the same household to be seated across multiple tables, allowing live entertainment such as live singing, dancing, music and games to be played within their premises, as well as failing to ensure temperature taking and proper check-ins via TraceTogether. Details and photos of the offences committed are in **Annex B**.

5 Four premises were fined between $1,000 to $2,000 each for breaching SMMs. Breaches included failure to ensure at least 1-metre safe distancing between seated customers. Please refer to **Annex C** for the list of outlets.

6 Eight individuals were fined $300 each for gathering in groups larger than the permitted group size while dining at various F&amp;B outlets.

**SMM breaches at parks and beaches**

7 A total of 79 individuals were fined for breaching SMMs from 17 to 20 July 2021 in parks and beaches managed by the National Parks Board (NParks). These breaches included not wearing masks when not engaging in strenuous exercises, and gathering in groups larger than the permitted limit. For example, NParks will be taking appropriate enforcement action against a group of 15 individuals who were caught gathering at Changi Beach Park. In addition, more than 1,500 advisories were issued to individuals for not wearing masks or for gathering in groups larger than the permitted limit.

**Everyone must remain vigilant**

8 Premises owners and individuals are urged to strictly adhere to SMMs as we tighten restrictions during Phase 2 (Heightened Alert). These restrictions are in place for everyone&#39;s safety and we must work together to help stem transmission of COVID-19 in the community. The Government will continue to review enforcement efforts on F&amp;B outlets to ensure SMMs are strictly adhered to. Agencies will not hesitate to take firm enforcement action against operators and individuals who flout SMMs.
