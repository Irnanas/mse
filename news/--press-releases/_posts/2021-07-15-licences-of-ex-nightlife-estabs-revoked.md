**F&B Licences for 3 Nightlife Operators that Pivoted to F&B Revoked; 11 Outlets and 31 Individuals Penalised for Breaching Safe Management Measures**

Following stepped-up enforcement checks in recent months, three Food and Beverage (F&amp;B) outlets that were formerly nightlife operators have had their licences to serve food revoked by the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) for breaching Safe Management Measures (SMMs). This is the first time that F&amp;B outlets have had their licences revoked for breaching SMMs since an enhanced penalty framework was implemented in May 2021. In addition, 11 F&amp;B outlets and 31 individuals were fined for breaching SMMs.

**Food Licences Revoked for 3 Ex-Nightlife Operators**

2 The three F&amp;B outlets, which previously operated as nightlife establishments before pivoting to F&amp;B, had their licences revoked for multiple breaches such as failing to minimise interaction between staff and customers, allowing groups of more than two people to sit together, and playing music. They must cease operations with immediate effect.Details and photos of the offences committed at these premises can be found in **Annexes A and B**.

3 Nightlife establishments were allowed to pivot temporarily to F&amp;B from October 2020. Unfortunately, a number of establishments continue to operate nightlife activities which are currently prohibited, including employing hostesses or permitting freelance hostesses to serve and drink with multiple groups of customers. Others have also flagrantly flouted SMMs in the process. Common SMM breaches committed by these nightlife operators which have pivoted towards F&amp;B operations include failing to prevent large groups of patrons from intermingling, and allowing live entertainment (e.g. live singing and dancing, playing of musical instruments) and games (e.g. dice and billiards).

**Fines issued to 11 outlets and 31 individuals for SMM breaches**

4 11 premises were fined between $1,000 to $2,000 each for breaching SMMs. Breaches included seating groups of customers less than one metre apart and allowing groups of more than two individuals who were not from the same household to be seated across multiple tables, and allowing consumption of alcohol on their premises beyond 10.30pm. Please refer to **Annex C** for the list of outlets.

5 Twenty-four individuals were fined $300 each for gathering in groups larger than the permitted group size while dining at various F&amp;B outlets, while seven staff were fined $300 for failing to wear masks.

**Everyone to remain vigilant in light of emerging clusters**

6 SMMs must be strictly adhered to by premises owners and individuals. . Agencies will not hesitate to take firm enforcement action against operators and individuals who flout SMMs. We must all do our part to prevent a resurgence from occurring in Singapore and continue to be vigilant to keep Singapore safe.
