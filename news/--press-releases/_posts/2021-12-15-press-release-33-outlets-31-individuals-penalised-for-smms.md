**33 F&amp;B Outlets and 31 Individuals Penalised for Breaching Safe Management Measures**

_Operators and members of the public reminded to observe safe management measures for the year-end period_

As we approach the year-end period, agencies will be stepping up enforcement at Food and Beverage (F&amp;B) outlets. This will include nightlife establishments which have pivoted to F&amp;B. With the emergence of the Omicron variant, we urge all Singaporeans not to let our guard down but to remain vigilant. We seek everyone&#39;s cooperation to continue to exercise social responsibility and rigorously observe safe management measures (SMMs) so as to keep Singapore safe.

**Breaches at F&amp;B Premises**

2 Since 1 December 2021, 22 F&amp;B outlets were ordered to close for SMM and Vaccination Differentiated SMMs (VDS) breaches such as failing to ensure that customers adhere to the permitted group size, failing to ensure a safe distance of at least 1 metre between groups of customers, and failing to minimise interaction between staff and customers.

3 11 other F&amp;B outlets and 31 individuals were issued composition fines for various SMM and VDS breaches. These included allowing music videos to be played within premises, failing to ensure a safe distance of at least 1 metre between seated customers, gathering in groups larger than the permitted size, and mask-related offences. Please refer to **Annex A** for details of offences, and **Annex B** for photos.

4 Strict compliance with SMMs (including VDS) is critical for everyone&#39;s safety, particularly amid the global risk of the Omicron variant. During the year-end festive period, agencies will step up checks on F&amp;B outlets to ensure that VDS and SMMs are strictly adhered to. Firm enforcement action will be taken against operators and individuals who do not comply with SMMs, including the proper wearing of masks. Enforcement action can be as severe as prosecution and the revocation of licences.

**Breaches at parks and beaches**

5 A total of 40 individuals&#39; particulars were taken from 1 to 13 December 2021 in parks and beaches managed by the National Parks Board (NParks), for gathering in groups larger than the permitted limit. In one such case, NParks will be taking enforcement actions against a group of 22 individuals who were found playing soccer at Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park.

6 All campsites and barbecue pits in NParks-managed parks and gardens remain closed. NParks will temporarily close access to some parks, sections of lawns, and facilities – such as lawns, hard courts, shelters and car parks – when these areas get too crowded or where users remain non-compliant with SMMs. This is necessary to ensure that the parks remain safe for everyone.

7      Members of the public are advised to check the Safe Distance @ Parks portal (safedistparks.nparks.gov.sg) for the latest updates on visitorship levels before heading to parks. We request all park visitors to be socially responsible and observe SMMs. These include keeping to the permitted group size, and wearing a mask except when engaging in strenuous exercises or consuming food, drink or medication.

**Staying Vigilant During the Year-End Period**

8 As we spend time with loved ones and friends this festive period, we urge everyone to take individual responsibility and exercise socially responsible behaviour. This is to protect their own health and that of others, amid the emerging threat of the Omicron variant. Please remain vigilant, observe SMMs, and avoid hotspots where possible. Seniors are urged to stay home, avoid crowded places, and go out only for essential activities over the next few weeks. Those who feel unwell or are sick should seek medical attention and stay home.
