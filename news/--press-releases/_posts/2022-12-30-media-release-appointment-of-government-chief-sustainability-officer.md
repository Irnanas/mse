**Singapore, 30 December 2022** – The Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) will establish the position of Government Chief Sustainability Officer (GCSO) to drive the Singapore Government’s sustainability efforts with effect from 1 Jan 2023.

2	The Singapore Green Plan 2030 is a whole-of-nation movement to advance Singapore’s national agenda on sustainable development. It charts ambitious and concrete targets over the next 10 years, strengthening Singapore’s commitments under the UN’s 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and the Paris Agreement, and positioning us to achieve our net zero emissions aspirations. Under the Green Plan, the public sector will strive to attain ambitious sustainability targets in carbon abatement and resource efficiency. This is being driven under the GreenGov.SG initiative.  The government will also partner corporates and community groups to catalyse ground-up initiatives to promote sustainability. 

3	MSE will appoint Mr Lim Tuang Liang as the first GCSO to drive these plans to realise a sustainable, resource-efficient and climate-resilient Singapore. Mr Lim will oversee MSE’s Public Sector Sustainability Office (PSSO) and Sustainability Partnerships Office (SPO) to work with public sector agencies to develop and coordinate strategies for GreenGov.SG as well as spearhead the Government’s partnership stakeholders, including businesses, civil society partners and individuals, to advance our national sustainability agenda. Mr Lim will be concurrently appointed as Deputy Secretary (Special Duties), MSE.  

4	Mr Lim will relinquish his current position as MSE’s Chief Science and Technology Officer (CSTO) when his replacement is appointed.
