#### Second Grant Call for SG Eco Fund Opens  

_New &quot;Sprout&quot; category for projects seeking funding of up to S$10,000_

1 The second grant call for the SG Eco Fund is open for application from today until 17 October 2021. This was announced by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, at Ricoh Eco Action Day 2021: The Future of Work.

2 To spur more ground-up action and encourage more applications, a new &quot;Sprout&quot; funding category catering to smaller community projects has been introduced. The Sprout category offers a simpler application process for projects seeking funding of up to S$10,000. Instead of a written proposal, Sprout project applicants will only need to submit a pitch deck and present it to the evaluation committee if they are shortlisted. The evaluation process will be simplified for Sprout projects. Applicants will know the outcome of their application within two months from the close of the grant call, as opposed to four months for the other applications.

3 The S$50 million SG Eco Fund was launched in November 2020 by the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment to support the co-creation of solutions for a sustainable Singapore. The first grant call was opened from 25 November 2020 to 31 January 2021, and 37 projects were awarded a total of S$3.7 million in funding in May 2021.

4 The Fund is open to the People, Private and Public (3P) sectors and aims to support ground-up projects that involve the community and advance environmental sustainability in Singapore. Projects across a broad range of areas related to sustainability, including climate change mitigation, waste reduction, as well as the conservation of nature and biodiversity, are supported. Individuals, non-governmental organisations and businesses with innovative ideas on sustainability, especially those with the potential for long-term impact, are welcome to apply for the Fund. Please refer to the Annex for more details on the eligibility and evaluation criteria.

5 The SG Eco Fund supports the Singapore Green Plan 2030, which is a national roadmap to advance Singapore&#39;s sustainability agenda. Building an active Green Citizenry, where individuals, communities and businesses play an active role for sustainability, is a key enabler in successfully implementing the strategies and meeting our targets under the Green Plan. The SG Eco Fund aims to empower everyone across the 3P sectors to take ownership of the environment and do their part to ensure Singapore remains a green and liveable home for our future generations.
