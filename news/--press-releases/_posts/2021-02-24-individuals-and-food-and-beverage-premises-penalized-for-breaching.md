**234 Individuals and 17 Food and Beverage Premises Penalised for Breaching Safe Management Measures**

**24 February 2021** – As part of stepped-up inspections to ensure compliance with Safe Management Measures (SMMs) during the Lunar New Year period, government agencies have continued to conduct enhanced checks on food and beverage (F&amp;B) premises, malls and other public spaces. Four F&amp;B outlets have been ordered to close, while 13 outlets were fined for breaching SMMs. 234 individuals were also issued fines for breaching SMMs at parks and beaches.

**Four F&amp;B outlets ordered to close**

2 Details of the offences committed at the F&amp;B outlets, and the orders for closure are as follows (photos in Annex A):

a. **Club One Min (Concorde Shopping Mall, #02-100)** was found to have allowed gatherings of more than eight individuals, and provided hostesses who intermingled with patrons on 19 February 2021. The Singapore Tourism Board has issued an order requiring the operator to close for 20 days from 20 February to 11 March 2021 (both dates inclusive). This is the outlet&#39;s second offence. It was previously closed for 10 days from 20 December to 29 December 2020 (both dates inclusive) for allowing groups of more than eight individuals. The Government takes a serious view of the violations by the operator and investigations are ongoing.

b. **Food Park Coffeeshop – Stall 8 (69 Bedok South Avenue 3)** was found to have allowed diners to consume alcohol after 10:30pm on 14 February 2021. The Singapore Food Agency has issued an order requiring the operator to close the stall for 10 days from 19 February to 28 February 2021 (both dates inclusive).

c. **Jin Jin Eating House (496 North Bridge Road)** was found to have allowed diners to consume alcohol after 10:30pm on 19 February 2021. The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has issued an order requiring the operator to close the outlet for 10 days from 23 February to 4 March 2021 (both dates inclusive).

d. **200 HCM Food (200 Joo Chiat Road)** was found to have allowed diners to consume alcohol after 10:30pm on 20 February 2021. URA has issued an order requiring the operator to close the outlet for 10 days from 23 February to 4 March 2021 (both dates inclusive).

**13 F&amp;B outlets issued fines**

3 13 F&amp;B outlets were fined $1,000 each for breaches that involved seating groups of diners less than 1 metre apart, and for failing to prevent intermingling between groups of customers (see Annex B).

**Enforcement against 234 individuals for SMM breaches at parks and beaches**

4 A total of 234 individuals were fined $300 each for breaching SMMs on 13 – 14 and 20 - 21 February 2021 in parks and beaches managed by the National Parks Board (NParks). These breaches included gathering in groups of more than eight people and intermingling between groups. In Changi Beach Park alone, 76 individuals were fined, including 20 who were caught gathering in one group (photo in Annex A).

**Continued crowd management measures and advisory for festive period**

5 Many F&amp;B premises and individuals have adhered to SMMs over the Lunar New Year period. We thank everyone for their cooperation. Nevertheless, social interactions are likely to increase as the festive period draws to a close, especially on the 15th day of the Lunar New Year or _chap goh meh_, and heighten the risk of COVID-19 transmission in the community. We urge members of the public and operators to remain vigilant and continue observing SMMs. Where possible, members of public are advised to plan visits to potentially crowded areas such as shopping malls, F&amp;B outlets, markets, supermarkets and parks, during off peak hours.

6 We would also like to remind members of the public that the limit of eight unique visitors a day for each household remains in place. Individuals should also limit themselves to visiting at most two other households per day. For the tossing of _yusheng_, masks must be worn and the _lo hei_ should be done without any verbal exhortations.

7 Multiple table bookings at F&amp;B premises for groups larger than eight persons are strictly prohibited, unless the diners are from the same household. Intermingling across different tables is not allowed.

8 Agencies will continue to step up enforcement checks at F&amp;B premises, parks, malls and other hotspots over this weekend. We will not hesitate to take firm enforcement action against errant operators and individuals. This includes fines, suspension of operations even for first offences, and prosecution for egregious breaches. Let us be socially responsible in observing all these measures to prevent a resurgence in community transmission of COVID-19.
