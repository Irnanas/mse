**8 F&B Outlets Ordered to Close; 13 other Outlets and 56 Individuals Fined for Breaching Safe Management Measures**

_Agencies will continue with stringent enforcement in coming weeks_

1 Following stepped-up enforcement checks over the past week, eight Food and Beverage (F&B) outlets were ordered to close, while 13 F&B outlets and 56 individuals were issued composition fines for breaching Safe Management Measures (SMMs). Members of the public and operators are urged to adhere strictly to SMMs. Agencies will continue with stringent enforcement checks over the coming weeks, as restrictions are further eased. 

2	Eight premises were ordered to close for breaches such as multiple failures to ensure patrons across tables were seated at least 1 metre apart, permitting intermingling between groups, and allowing groups of more than two individuals who were not from the same household to be seated across multiple tables. Details and photos of the offences committed at premises that were ordered to close can be found in **Annexes A and B**. 

**Fines issued to 13 outlets and 23 individuals for SMM breaches**

3	13 premises were fined $1,000 each for breaching SMMs. Breaches included seating groups of customers less than 1 metre apart and playing recorded music for customers. Please refer to **Annex C** for the list of outlets. 

4	20 individuals were fined $300 each for gathering in groups larger than two while dining at various F&B outlets, while three staff from a food establishment were fined $300 for failing to wear masks.

**SMM breaches at parks and beaches**

5	A total of 33 individuals were fined for breaching SMMs from 2 - 4 July 2021 in parks and beaches managed by the National Parks Board (NParks). These breaches included not wearing masks when not engaging in strenuous exercises, and gathering in groups larger than the permitted limit. For example, two groups of 11 and 13 individuals each were caught gathering at Kallang Riverside Park. In addition, more than 900 advisories were issued to individuals for not wearing masks or for gathering in groups larger than the permitted limit.  

6	All water play areas, water recreational facilities, campsites and barbecue pits in NParks-managed parks and gardens will remain closed. NParks will temporarily close access to some parks, sections of beaches, lawns, and facilities – such as hard courts, shelters and car parks – when these areas get too crowded or where people remain non-compliant with SMMs, to ensure that the parks remain safe for everyone.

7	Members of the public are advised to check the Safe Distance @ Parks portal (safedistparks.nparks.gov.sg) for the latest updates on visitorship levels before heading to parks. We request all park visitors to be socially responsible and observe SMMs such as keeping to the permitted group size, and to wear a mask except when engaging in strenuous exercises or consuming food, drink or medication, to keep our green spaces safe for everyone.

**Everyone strongly advised to comply with strict SMMs**

8	Dining in at F&B establishments continues to be a higher-risk activity. As restrictions are eased to allow groups of up to five people to dine in from 12 July 2021, we urge everyone to observe all SMMs and practise good hygiene to curb the spread of COVID-19. These include maintaining a safe distance when queuing to purchase food or waiting for orders, keeping masks on when not eating or drinking, keeping to groups of five, not intermingling between groups, and not sitting on cordoned off or marked seats. Agencies will continue to enforce against any breaches at these premises and identified hotspots based on public feedback and ground observations. 

9	First time individual offenders face a composition fine of $300. Repeat offenders will face higher fines, or prosecution in court for egregious cases. Operators that breach SMMs, including 1 metre safe distancing between groups of diners, face closures, even for first offences.
