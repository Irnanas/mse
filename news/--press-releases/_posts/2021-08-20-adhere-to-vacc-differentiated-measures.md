**Operators and Patrons Advised to Adhere Strictly to Vaccination Differentiated Safe Management Measures**

_30 Outlets and 59 Individuals Penalised for Breaching Safe Management Measures_

Following the resumption of dine-in and the implementation of Vaccination Differentiated Safe Management Measures (VDS) on 10 August 2021, Safe Distancing Enforcement Officers (EOs) from various government agencies conducted checks on more than 700 food and beverage (F&amp;B) premises and over 2,000 individuals over the past weekend to ensure compliance with VDS measures. Separately, for breaching safe management measures (SMMs), 8 F&amp;B outlets were ordered to close, while 22 F&amp;B outlets and 59 individuals were issued composition fines. Enforcement checks will continue to be stepped up to guard against community transmission in higher risk settings, such as F&amp;B premises, even as Singapore continues to reopen gradually.

**Enforcement Checks on VDS at F&amp;B Premises**

2 Agencies found that of the over 700 F&amp;B operators checked, most were compliant with VDS and familiar with the requisite processes to check on patrons&#39; vaccination status. Operators were observed to be turning away patrons who could not prove that they were fully vaccinated, i.e. did not have a cleared status. The vast majority of over 2,000 patrons checked by our EOs were also found to have a cleared status.

3 However, more than 5 operators were found to have breached VDS requirements by failing to check the vaccination status of patrons before granting them entry. Close to 10 patrons were found to have dined in without a cleared status; most of them had completed the second dose of the vaccine but had not waited two weeks for the vaccine to take effect. As this was the first week of implementing the VDS, operators and patrons were given allowance to adjust to the new VDS and stern warnings were issued. No patrons were found to have falsified their vaccination status.

4 Agencies will continue to step up checks to ensure compliance with VDS at F&amp;B premises, including checks on the vaccination status of patrons dining in. Starting this weekend, strict enforcement action will be taken against operators and individuals who flout VDS. Operators which fail to check the vaccination status of patrons before granting them entry could face fines and/or closures.Patrons who make false representations about their vaccination status to dine in at F&amp;B outlets could face fines and/or imprisonment.

**8 F&amp;B Premises Ordered to Close; Fines issued to 22 Outlets and 59 Individuals for SMM Breaches**

5 8 F&amp;B premises were ordered to close for multiple SMM breaches such as allowing liquor consumption past 10.30pm and failing to ensure a safe distance of at least 1 metre between groups of customers. Details and photos of the offences committed are in **Annex A**.

6 22 premises were fined between $1,000 to $4,000 each for breaching SMMs such as failing to ensure a safe distance of at least 1 metre between seated customers. Please refer to **Annex B** for the list of outlets.

7 59 individuals were fined between $300 to $1,000 for SMM breaches such as gathering in groups larger than the permitted group size while dining at various F&amp;B outlets, or failing to wear a mask when not eating/drinking.

**Towards a COVID-19 Resilient Singapore**

8 Both F&amp;B operators and patrons are strongly urged to adhere strictly to SMMs. These restrictions are in place for everyone&#39;s safety, and we must work together to stem the transmission of COVID-19 in the community. The Government will continue to review enforcement efforts on F&amp;B premises and other public spaces to ensure SMMs are adhered to.
