#### Agencies will step up enforcement during the Lunar New Year Period

*56 Businesses and 360 Individuals Penalised for Breaching Safe Management Measures*

**28 January 2022** – During the upcoming festive period, agencies will be stepping up enforcement athotspots including Food and Beverage (F&amp;B) outlets, markets, malls, supermarkets and parks. Since the start of 2022, 56 F&amp;B outlets and 360 individuals have been penalised for breaching Safe Management Measures (SMMs) and Vaccination Differentiated SMMs (VDS). With the surge in Omicron variant infections in Singapore, we seek everyone&#39;s cooperation to continue to exercise individual responsibility and strictly adhere to SMMs. This will help to keep yourselves and the community safe.

**Breaches at businesses and other public spaces**

2 Since the start of 2022, 27 businesses (including F&amp;B establishments, hotels and malls) were ordered to close for breaches of SMMs, such as failing to minimise interactions between staff and diners, failing to ensure that groups of patrons did not exceed the maximum permitted group size, and allowing diners to consume alcohol after 10.30 pm. An order was issued to close F&amp;B outlet (Candy K-Bar) for 20 days, for allowing a social gathering above the permitted group size, allowing the sale and consumption of alcohol past 10.30 pm and providing a KTV system and dart games to customers. The customers – who were colleagues at another F&amp;B establishment – subsequently tested positive for COVID-19 and infected at least 10 other co-workers who did not attend the social gathering. Further investigations are being conducted.

3 29 other businesses were issued composition fines for breaches such as failing to ensure a safe distance of at least 1 metre between seated customers, failing to ensure staff were wearing masks, and failing to check patrons&#39; vaccination status. Please refer to **Annex A** for details of the offences, and **Annex B** for photos.

4 341 individuals were fined for breaches of SMMs and VDS such as gathering in groups larger than the permitted size and mask-related offences at places including hawker centres, F&amp;B establishments and hotels.

5 On 23 January 2022, the particulars of 19 individuals were taken for gathering in groups larger than the permitted size in parks and beaches managed by NParks. This included a group of 11 individuals at Toa Payoh Town Park. NParks will be taking appropriate enforcement action against them.

**Keeping our celebrations safe**

6 Members of the public are reminded that each household may only receive up to 5 unique visitors per day during the Lunar New Year festive period. Individuals are encouraged to take a self-administered Antigen Rapid Test (ART) in advance of such gatherings, particularly if there will be elderly or unvaccinated family members present.
