**3 F&amp;B Outlets Ordered to Close for Breaching Vaccination Differentiated Safe Management Measures;8 F&amp;B Outlets and 10 Individuals Penalised for Breaching Safe Management Measures**

1 Following stepped-up enforcement over the past week, three F&amp;B outlets have been ordered to close for breaching Vaccination Differentiated Safe Management Measures (VDS). Seven other F&amp;B outlets were ordered to close, and one F&amp;B outlet and ten individuals were fined for breaching safe management measures (SMMs). Enforcement checks will continue to be stepped up to guard against community transmission in higher risk settings, such as F&amp;B premises, even as Singapore continues to reopen gradually.

**VDS Breaches at F&amp;B Premises**

2 Over the past week, agencies checked nearly 700 premises and over 2,500 individuals for adherence to VDS. The three premises ordered to close had failed to check the vaccination status of customers before granting them entry, and allowed individuals without a cleared status
 to dine in. Please refer to **Annex A** for details of offences committed, and **Annex B** for photos.

**SMM Breaches at F&amp;B Premises**

3 Seven premises were ordered to close for SMM breaches such as playing music in the premises, failing to minimise interaction between staff and customers,allowing the sale and consumption of alcohol after 10.30 pm, and failing to ensure a safe distance of at least 1 metre between groups of customers.

4 Another premise and ten individuals were issued composition fines for SMM breaches, such as gathering in groups larger than the permitted group size while dining at F&amp;B outlets, failure to ensure a safe distance of at least 1 metre between seated customers, and failing to wear a mask when not eating/drinking. Please refer to **Annex C** for details of offences, and **Annex D** for photos.

**Towards a COVID-19 Resilient Singapore**

5 Both F&amp;B operators and patrons should adhere strictly to the VDS and SMMs. These measures are in place to safeguard our community. The Government will continue to step up checks and take firm enforcement action.
