#### SG ECO FUND REVIEWS GRANT CALL CYCLES TO ENCOURAGE MORE APPLICATIONS

_Review follows feedback from applicants of the first two grant calls_

1. **27 APRIL 2022** â€“ The SG Eco Fund will be introducing two key changes to the annual grant cycles, starting from 1 May 2022. This was announced by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, at the launch of City Sprouts Sustainability Centre earlier today. City Sprouts was a recipient of the SG Eco Fund under the first grant call.

2. Starting this year, the Main category of the SG Eco Fund will have a fixed application window from 1 May to 31 August. This will give applicants greater clarity and certainty for project planning.

3. The second change is that the Sprout category of the SG Eco Fund will be open for applications throughout the year. Previously, the application window for the Sprout category was aligned to the Main category. With the revision, SG Eco Fund hopes to support more community projects, including programmes and outreach workshops.

4. The Sprout category was introduced in August 2021 to simplify the application process for projects seeking funding of up to S$10,000. Instead of a written proposal, shortlisted Sprout applicants only need to submit a pitch deck and present it to the evaluation committee. This would shorten the evaluation process, typically taking about two months from the close of the grant call to final decision.

5. The S$50 million SG Eco Fund was launched in November 2020 by the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment. The Fund supports ground-up projects that involve the community and advance environmental sustainability in Singapore. Since its launch, 105 individuals and organisations have been awarded $6.6 million in funding. Some of the grantees were also present at the Sustainability Centre today to showcase their projects and interact with the community. More details of these grantees can be found in the **Annex**.

6. Following the first two grant calls in 2020 and 2021, the SG Eco Office sought feedback from past applicants on ways to improve the application process. The revisions to the SG Eco Fund grant cycle are based on the feedback received.

7. Interested applicants can apply for the SG Eco Fund at [www.mse.gov.sg/sgecofund](http://www.mse.gov.sg/sgecofund) from 1 May 2022 onwards.
