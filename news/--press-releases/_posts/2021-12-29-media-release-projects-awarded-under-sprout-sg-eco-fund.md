#### 42 Projects Awarded $280,000 Funding under SG Eco Fund's New "Sprout" Category

*Projects include community gardens and initiatives to promote upcycling and reduce food waste* 

**29 DECEMBER 2021** – A total of 42 projects will obtain funding under a new “Sprout” category of the SG Eco Fund. The applications were submitted during the SG Eco Fund’s second grant call, which was open from 26 August to 17 October 2021.

2 The “Sprout” category was introduced to simplify the application process for projects seeking funding of up to S$10,000. Instead of a written proposal, applicants with “Sprout” projects only need to submit a pitch deck and present it to the evaluation committee if shortlisted. The evaluation process is also faster, typically taking about two months from the close of the grant call, compared to four months for other applications.

3 A total of 241 applications were received from the second grant call, including 110 under the “Sprout” category. Of these 110 applications, 42 “Sprout” projects were selected and will receive funding of about S$280,000 in total. The outcomes for the rest of the applications will be announced in early 2022. Please refer to the **Annex** for the full list of the 42 awarded projects under the “Sprout” category.

4 Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, said: “I’m heartened by the continued positive response to the SG Eco Fund. All of us can play a part in co-creating solutions to help realise the Singapore Green Plan 2030. Through the new Sprout category under the SG Eco Fund, we hope to empower more individuals and community groups to take ownership of the environment. No effort or idea is too small, and I encourage more people to come forward and apply for the Fund.” 

5 The S$50 million SG Eco Fund was launched in November 2020 by the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment. The Fund supports ground-up projects that involve the community and advance environmental sustainability in Singapore, including climate change mitigation, waste reduction, as well as the conservation of nature and biodiversity. During the first grant call, 37 projects were awarded a total of S$3.7 million in funding in May 2021.
