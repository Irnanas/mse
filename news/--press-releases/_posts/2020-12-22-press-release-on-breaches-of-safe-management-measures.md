#### Five Food and Beverage Premises Ordered to Close, 52 Fines to be Issued for Breaches of Safe Management Measures  

Five Food and Beverage (F&B) outlets have been ordered to close, and 16 outlets and 36 individuals will be fined for breaching Safe Management Measures (SMMs). These breaches were found during the stepped-up enforcement checks conducted over the last weekend.  

**Five outlets ordered to close**  

2 Details of the offences at the five F&B outlets and the orders for closure are as follows (photos at Annex):  

a) On 18 December, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) issued an order requiring Cheers Up (2 Havelock Road, #02-09, Havelock II) to close for 10 days from 19 December to 28 December (both dates inclusive) for allowing patrons to consume alcoholic beverages past 10.30pm on 11 December 2020. When officers did a follow-up check on 18 December, they found Cheers Up still allowing patrons to consume alcoholic beverages at 11.15pm. URA issued another closure order, this time for 20 days from 29 December 2020 to 17 January 2021 (both dates inclusive).  

b) On 19 December, One Min Club (100 Orchard Road, #02-100, Concorde Hotel), was found to have committed multiple breaches of SMMs: (i) a group of seven individuals were seated together at a table; (ii) a group of 11 individuals were seated at another table; and (iii) the operator had provided drinking games to patrons. Under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020, F&B establishments are not permitted to provide games if they are not also an amusement centre. The Singapore Tourism Board (STB) has issued an order requiring the operator to close the premises for a period of 10 days from 20 to 29 Dec 2020 (both dates inclusive).  

c) On 19 December, officers observed patrons at Tangmen (150 Orchard Road, #03-35, Orchard Plaza) consuming alcoholic beverages at 3.40am. The alcoholic beverages were concealed in green tea bottles. STB has issued an order requiring the operator to close the premises for a period of 10 days from 19 to 28 Dec 2020 (both dates inclusive).  

d) On 19 December, Chong Qing Steamboat (87 Beach Road, #01-02) was found to have a group of eight patrons intermingling at 10pm. URA has issued an order requiring the operator to close the premises for a period of 10 days from 23 December to 1 January 2021 (both dates inclusive).  

e) On 19 December, officers observed patrons at QQ (77 South Bridge Road, #01-01) consuming alcoholic beverages at 10.40pm. URA has issued an order requiring the operator to close the premises for a period of 10 days from 23 December to 1 January 2021 (both dates inclusive).  

**Fines Issued to F&B Outlets and Individuals**  

3 16 F&B outlets will be fined for breaching SMMs, such as admitting and seating groups of more than five together, allowing groups to intermingle, and seating groups of patrons less than 1 metre apart.  

4 A total of 36 individuals will also be fined for not observing SMMs at F&B outlets. These breaches involved gathering and sitting in groups of more than five and intermingling between groups.  

5 Other breaches observed during the inspections involved seating groups of patrons less than 1 metre apart, and the serving and consumption of alcohol past 10.30pm. Agencies are reviewing the breaches and the appropriate enforcement actions to be taken, including temporary closure of the outlets and the issuance of fines. F&B outlets with repeated offences will face harsher penalties.  

6 COVID-19 remains a grave threat and we must remain vigilant particularly during the festive period. While many may wish to meet up with family and friends, or visit popular areas for shopping, dining out or other social activities, we urge everyone to be socially responsible, observe the SMMs and wear a mask unless you are drinking or eating. This will help to safeguard public health, while allowing businesses to remain open. The Government will not hesitate to take strong enforcement action against operators and individuals who treat SMMs with flagrant disregard.
