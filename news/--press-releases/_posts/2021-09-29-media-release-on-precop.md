#### Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu to attend United Nations Climate Change Pre-Conference in Milan, Italy     

1 Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, will be attending the United Nations (UN) Climate Change Pre-Conference (Pre-COP26) in Milan, Italy, from 30 September to 2 October 2021. Minister Fu is attending at the invitation of Italy Ecological Transition Minister Roberto Cingolani and incoming UK COP26 President-designate Alok Sharma.   

2 At Pre-COP26, Ministers and representatives from around 50 countries will discuss and exchange views on key political aspects of the negotiations and negotiating topics for COP26, which will be held in Glasgow, UK, in November 2021.   

3 A key issue that Ministers will discuss is the guidance for operationalising Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which remains unresolved under the Paris Agreement Work Programme. At the invitation of the incoming UK COP26 President-designate, Minister Fu, together with her Norwegian counterpart, will continue to facilitate discussions on Article 6, with a view to advancing its work in the lead up to COP26.   

4 Ministers attending Pre-COP26 will also engage youth delegates at a Youth4Climate event on 30 September 2021, on the priorities and urgency of climate action.
