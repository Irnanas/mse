**Singapore, 14 November 2022** – Singapore and Papua New Guinea signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) today to collaborate on cooperative approaches, aligned with Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement. The MOU was signed by Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu and Papua New Guinea’s Minister for Environment, Conservation and Climate Change Simo Kilepa at the Singapore Pavilion on the sidelines of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27), in Sharm el-Sheik, Egypt.
  
2 The MOU will facilitate collaboration on carbon markets which are critical to advance global climate action towards the Paris Agreement goals. Such collaboration can unlock additional mitigation outcomes to advance both countries’ climate ambitions. Singapore is committed to ensure the integrity, quality and transparency of carbon markets. This includes robust and independent accounting, and the avoidance of double counting, including requiring corresponding adjustments. The collaboration will also prioritise sustainable development and co-benefits to the local communities and economy. 

3 Minister Fu said, “The signing of this MOU underscores the shared commitment of Singapore and Papua New Guinea to drive sustainable development. Over the years, developments in carbon markets, including the finalisation of Article 6 rulebook and initiatives such as Climate Action Data (CAD) Trust, give us confidence that we can scale up carbon markets while ensuring environmental integrity and transparency are upheld. We believe that international collaboration, such as this agreement between Singapore and Papua New Guinea, is critical to accelerate global climate action to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement”.

4 A working group comprising Singapore and Papua New Guinea government officials will be established to oversee the implementation of this MOU.
