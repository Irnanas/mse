#### 60 F&amp;B Outlets Penalised for Breaching Safe Management Measures**

_Seniors urged to stay home and to only go out for essential activities_

**8 October 2021** – Since mid-September, 36 Food and Beverage (F&amp;B) outlets were ordered to close, and another 21 F&amp;B outlets were fined for breaches of Safe Management Measures (SMMs) and Vaccination Differentiated SMMs (VDS). Food licences for three pivoted nightlife establishments have been permanently revoked.

**VDS Breaches at F&amp;B Premises**

2 During this period, agencies checked more than 600 premises and over 900 individuals for adherence to VDS. Four F&amp;B outlets were found to have allowed individuals without a cleared status
# 1
 to enter or remain within their premises to consume food or drinks. Please refer to **Annex A** for details of the VDS offences.

**SMM Breaches at F&amp;B Premises**

3 34 F&amp;B outlets were ordered to close for SMM breaches such as allowing customers to play card games in the premises, failing to ensure customers adhered to the permitted group size, and failing to ensure a safe distance of at least 1 metre between groups of customers.

4 19 other F&amp;B outlets were issued composition fines for various SMM breaches on their premises. These included gathering in groups larger than the permitted group size, playing music or video recordings, allowing singing, failing to ensure workers wore masks, failing to ensure contact tracing was done for employees, and failing to ensure a safe distance of at least 1 metre between seated customers. Please refer to **Annex B** for details of offences, and **Annex C** for photos.

**Permanent Revocation of Licence for Pivoted Nightlife Establishments**

5 Three pivoted nightlife establishments had their food licences permanently revoked. The pivoted nightlife establishments were found to be operating with dine-in patrons, despite not being allowed to re-open. Please refer to **Annex D** for details of offences.

6 We would like to remind both F&amp;B operators and patrons that strict compliance with SMMs (including VDS) is critical for everyone&#39;s safety. Agencies will continue to step up checks on F&amp;B and pivoted nightlife establishments to ensure that VDS and SMMs are strictly adhered to. Firm enforcement action will be taken against operators and individuals who do not comply with SMMs, including the proper wearing of masks. This includes prosecution and revocation of licences for food, public entertainment, and liquor.

**Seniors Urged to Stay Home**

7 With more COVID-19 cases being reported, we urge seniors to stay home, avoid crowded places, and go out only for essential activities over the next few weeks. Seniors, especially those unvaccinated, are at higher risk of developing serious complications if infected. Seniors should avoid congregating at hawker centres and coffeeshops, and instead consider packing food, ordering online, or asking a friend or family member to buy food on their behalf instead of dining in. Seniors are also reminded to maintain good personal hygiene by ensuring that their masks are worn properly and not pulled down while talking, washing their hands regularly, and avoiding touching their faces.

8 We urge everyone to exercise socially responsible behaviour to protect their own health and that of others. Those who feel unwell or are sick should seek medical attention and stay home.
