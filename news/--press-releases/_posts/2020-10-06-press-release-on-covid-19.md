#### Two More Food and Beverage Premises Ordered to Close, 13 Outlets and 21 Individuals Issued Fines for Breaching Safe Management Measures  

**6 October 2020** â€“ Two more Food and Beverage (F&B) outlets have been ordered to close, while 13 outlets and 21 individuals have been issued fines for breaching Safe Management Measures (SMMs).  

2	Details of the two F&B outlets ordered to close, and the offences, are below (photos at Annex):  

a. On 3 October, nine customers were seated across two tables and intermingling in a private room at Tong Xin Ru Yi Traditional Hotpot at 6 Lorong Telok, Singapore 049019, at 9.15pm. The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) issued an order requiring the operator to close the premises for a period of 10 days from 6 October to 15 October 2020 (both dates inclusive).  

b. On 2 October 2020, several customers were found consuming alcohol at 11.40pm at the Invincible Noodle House at 13 Circular Road, Singapore 049369. The URA issued an order requiring the operator to close the premises for a period of 10 days from 3 October to 12 October 2020 (both dates inclusive).  

3	Another 13 F&B outlets have been fined for breaching SMMs since 25 September 2020. The breaches included admitting and seating groups of more than five from different households together, allowing groups to intermingle between tables, seating groups of customers less than 1 metre apart, and not ensuring that food handlers wear their masks properly. Twelve of the outlets were fined $1,000 for breaching the measures and one outlet was fined $2,000 for repeat offences. The outlets are listed in the Annex.  

**Fines Issued to Individuals**  

4	A total of 21 individuals will also be fined $300 each for not observing SMMs at F&B outlets on 2 and 3 October 2020. These breaches involved gathering and sitting in groups of more than five, intermingling between tables and not putting on masks promptly after eating or drinking. The breaches by these individuals were observed in F&B outlets at Resorts World Sentosa, Boat Quay and Clarke Quay.  

5	Masks should be worn at all times unless when eating or drinking, or doing strenuous activities, regardless of premises. In particular, dining is an activity that involves considerable risks because people are gathered in an enclosed space, without their masks on, and for a prolonged duration. While we understand that diners tend to continue their conversations and interaction after meals at F&B outlets, they should do so with their masks on to prevent the spread of droplets.  

**Additional Inspections of 77 F&B Outlets**  

6	From 2 to 3 October 2020, government agencies conducted additional inspections on 77 F&B outlets in known hotspots. Among these, four were found to have breached SMMs. The breaches involved groups of more than five seated together or intermingling between tables, seating groups of customers less than 1 metre apart and the serving and consumption of alcohol past 10.30pm.  

7	While the majority of patrons observe SMMs, there remains a minority who continue to breach them. Those who breach the SMMs will face enforcement action, such as fines, without further warning. The Government will continue with enforcement checks at F&B outlets around Singapore to ensure that they remain safe spaces for all. We urge patrons to be socially responsible and observe the SMMs. Agencies will not hesitate to take enforcement actions against both patrons and premises that do not comply with SMMs.
