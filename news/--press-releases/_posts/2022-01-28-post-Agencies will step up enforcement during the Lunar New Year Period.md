#### Agencies will step up enforcement during the Lunar New Year Period

*56 Businesses and 360 Individuals Penalised for Breaching Safe Management Measures*

**28 January 2022** – During the upcoming festive period, agencies will be stepping up enforcement athotspots including Food and Beverage (F&amp;B) outlets, markets, malls, supermarkets and parks. Since the start of 2022, 56 F&amp;B outlets and 360 individuals have been penalised for breaching Safe Management Measures (SMMs) and Vaccination Differentiated SMMs (VDS). With the surge in Omicron variant infections in Singapore, we seek everyone&#39;s cooperation to continue to exercise individual responsibility and strictly adhere to SMMs. This will help to keep yourselves and the community safe.

**Breaches at businesses and other public spaces**

2 Since the start of 2022, 27 businesses (including F&amp;B establishments, hotels and malls) were ordered to close for breaches of SMMs, such as failing to minimise interactions between staff and diners, failing to ensure that groups of patrons did not exceed the maximum permitted group size, and allowing diners to consume alcohol after 10.30 pm. An order was issued to close F&amp;B outlet (Candy K-Bar) for 20 days, for allowing a social gathering above the permitted group size, allowing the sale and consumption of alcohol past 10.30 pm and providing a KTV system and dart games to customers. The customers – who were colleagues at another F&amp;B establishment – subsequently tested positive for COVID-19 and infected at least 10 other co-workers who did not attend the social gathering. Further investigations are being conducted.

3 29 other businesses were issued composition fines for breaches such as failing to ensure a safe distance of at least 1 metre between seated customers, failing to ensure staff were wearing masks, and failing to check patrons&#39; vaccination status. Please refer to **Annex A** for details of the offences, and **Annex B** for photos.

4 341 individuals were fined for breaches of SMMs and VDS such as gathering in groups larger than the permitted size and mask-related offences at places including hawker centres, F&amp;B establishments and hotels.

5 On 23 January 2022, the particulars of 19 individuals were taken for gathering in groups larger than the permitted size in parks and beaches managed by NParks. This included a group of 11 individuals at Toa Payoh Town Park. NParks will be taking appropriate enforcement action against them.

**Keeping our celebrations safe**

6 Members of the public are reminded that each household may only receive up to 5 unique visitors per day during the Lunar New Year festive period. Individuals are encouraged to take a self-administered Antigen Rapid Test (ART) in advance of such gatherings, particularly if there will be elderly or unvaccinated family members present.

7 Prevailing rules at F&amp;B premises will continue to apply, including to reunion dinners and other Lunar New Year meals at these establishments. Multiple table bookings at F&amp;B premises for groups larger than five persons are strictly prohibited, unless the diners are from the same household. Intermingling across different tables is strictly not allowed. We strongly advise F&amp;B operators to double-check the reservations they have already received to ensure that the bookings are in order. _Lo hei_ should be done without any shouting of auspicious phrases, and diners should remain masked when tossing the ingredients. Serving and consuming alcohol after 10.30 pm are strictly prohibited. We also remind diners not to circumvent the rules for the sake of their loved ones and the well-being of the community.

8 Strict compliance with SMMs is critical for everyone&#39;s safety. Firm enforcement action will be taken against operators and individuals who do not comply with SMMs, including the proper wearing of masks. Enforcement action can be as severe as prosecution and the revocation of licences.

**Stepped up enforcement inspections and crowd management measures during festive period**

9 We strongly urge members of the public to plan visits to Chinatown and other popular areas in advance and visit during off-peak hours. Visitors are reminded to comply with prevailing SMMs, such as proper wearing of masks, and keeping to groups of five individuals or less. Agencies will increase enforcement checks across businesses such as F&amp;B outlets, including nightlife establishments which have pivoted to F&amp;B. Safe Distancing Ambassadors (SDAs) and Enforcement Officers (EOs) will continue to be deployed daily during the festive period to enforce SMMs at various premises and public spaces, including during peak hours, weekends and at hotspots:

1. The Singapore Tourism Board (STB) will introduce additional measures at Chinatown where required to reduce crowding, and increase enforcement efforts to ensure compliance to SMMs. To manage crowds, Temple Street will be closed to vehicular traffic from 12pm on 31 January 2022 to 2am on 1 February 2022. Visitors can also check the latest safety measures in Chinatown on the Singapore Chinatown Facebook page ([https://www.facebook.com/ChinatownSGcsm/](https://www.facebook.com/ChinatownSGcsm/)) before visiting.

1. In anticipation of a rise in footfall to the market and hawker centre in Chinatown Complex, the National Environment Agency and Jalan Besar Town Council have increased the number of safe distancing personnel deployed. Access control with interim fencing is in place at the market, and patrons are not allowed to enter once the number of patrons reaches the stipulated allowable capacity of 300 persons. The regulation of the inflow of patrons takes into account localised crowding that can occur within the market. Patrons are encouraged to visit the markets during non-peak hours, such as the early hours of the morning. Patrons are reminded to wear their masks properly and maintain a safe distance from others when making purchases from a stall. The elderly, especially the unvaccinated, should refrain from visiting the markets during this time, and ask family members or younger friends to assist with purchasing essential items and packing meals.

1. All campsites and barbecue pits in NParks-managed parks and gardens remain closed. NParks will temporarily close access to some areas in our parks – such as lawns, hard courts, shelters and car parks – when these areas get too crowded or where users remain non-compliant with SMMs. This is necessary to ensure that the parks remain safe for everyone.

Members of the public are advised to check the Safe Distance @ Parks portal (safedistparks.nparks.gov.sg) for the latest updates on visitorship levels before heading to parks. We request all park visitors to be socially responsible and observe SMMs. These include keeping to the permitted group size and wearing a mask except when engaging in strenuous exercises or consuming food, drink or medication.

10 While we understand this festive period is a time for reunion with loved ones, there is a strong need to exercise caution amid the surging Omicron infections. Let us continue to be socially responsible and adhere to prevailing measures. This will allow everyone to enjoy the festivities safely and help Singapore ride through the Omicron wave.
