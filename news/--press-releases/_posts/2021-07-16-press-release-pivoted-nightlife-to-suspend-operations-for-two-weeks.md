**Nightlife Operators that Pivoted to F&amp;B to Suspend Operations for Two Weeks**

As announced by the Multi-Ministry Task Force, nightlife establishments that were allowed to pivot to Food and Beverage (F&amp;B) operations since October 2020 will be required to suspend operations for two weeks from 16 July 2021 to 30 July 2021.

2 This suspension of operations is intended to break community transmission from the latest cluster of COVID-19 cases involving nightlife establishments. The suspension allows time for all employees at all pivoted establishments to be tested, and for enforcement agencies to conduct checks to ensure that Safe Management Measures (SMMs) protocols are in place.

3 Outlets will only be allowed to resume operations after 30 July 2021 if they pass the inspection and receive approval from the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) to resume operations. Some of the requirements to be met include:

A All employees have undergone PCR tests for COVID-19.

B Agencies have conducted checks and are satisfied that SMM protocols are in place. This includes measures to ensure that:  

  * Prevailing group size limits will be adhered to  
  * Groups of patrons are seated at least one metre apart  
  * There will be no intermingling between patrons and the staff  
  * There will not be singing, playing of loud music and any other forms of entertainment  
  * Safe Entry Gateway check-in boxes are in place for both entry and exit to facilitate contact tracing.  

4 In the next few days, SFA and relevant enforcement agencies will reach out to affected operators on the requirements and follow ups. F&amp;B operators with queries may email [covid\_gobusiness@mti.gov.sg](mailto:covid_gobusiness@mti.gov.sg) or call +65 68981800.

5 All pivoted nightlife establishments must comply strictly with this suspension. Any outlet found to be operating during this period will face firm enforcement action, including prosecution and the permanent cancellation of licences for food, public entertainment and liquor.

6 Given the recent flagrant SMM breaches by a number of pivoted nightlife operators, all applications from nightlife operators seeking to convert to F&amp;B establishments will be suspended with immediate effect. The suspension of applications will be in force for three months, pending further review.

7 We note that the suspension will significantly disrupt the business activities of nightlife establishments which had pivoted to F&amp;B operations. Unfortunately, our enforcement checks have found that a number of such establishments have continued to conduct prohibited activities, including allowing hostessing and karaoke, or flagrantly flouting SMMs, including allowing large groups of patrons to intermingle. Since May 2021, agencies had stepped up enforcement checks and tightened our penalty framework. Three outlets have had their licences revoked and we will take action against any egregious offenders. This two-week suspension for pivoted operators will serve to keep our community safe and ensure that SMMs are closely complied with.

8 The Government will continue to review enforcement efforts on F&amp;B outlets to ensure SMMs are strictly adhered to. Agencies will not hesitate to take firm enforcement action against operators and individuals who flout SMMs.
