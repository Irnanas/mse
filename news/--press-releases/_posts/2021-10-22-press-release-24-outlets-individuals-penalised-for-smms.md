**24 F&amp;B Outlets and 24 Individuals Penalised for Breaching Safe Management Measures**

_Members of the public reminded to exercise social responsibility and observe safe management measures in the run-up to Deepavali_

15 Food and Beverage (F&amp;B) outlets have been ordered to close, and 9 F&amp;B outlets and 24 individuals have been fined for breaches of Safe Management Measures (SMMs) and Vaccination Differentiated SMMs (VDS) since 9 October 2021. These are in addition to enforcement action taken as part of stepped up enforcement for breaches of SMMs at hawker centres by the National Environment Agency (NEA) between 8 and 17 October 2021

**VDS Breaches at F&amp;B Premises**

2 During this period, agencies checked more than 1,000 premises and over 3,700 individuals for adherence to VDS. One F&amp;B outlet, Katong Eating House Pte Ltd (865 Mountbatten Road #B1-85/87), failed to implement checks to ensure that only individuals with a cleared status enter or remain within their premises to consume food or drinks. The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) issued an order that required the operator to close for 10 days from 15 to 24 October 2021 (both dates inclusive).

**SMM Breaches at F&amp;B Premises**

3 14 F&amp;B outlets were ordered to close for SMM breaches such as failing to ensure customers adhered to the permitted group size, failing to ensure a safe distance of at least 1 metre between groups of customers, allowing verbal exhortation of goodwill (e.g. singing and toasting), and allowing music to be played within its premises.

4 9 other F&amp;B outlets were issued composition fines for various SMM breaches on their premises. These included allowing singing and failing to ensure a safe distance of at least 1 metre between seated customers. Please refer to **Annex A** for details of offences, and **Annex B** for photos.

5 Strict compliance with SMMs (including VDS) is critical for everyone&#39;s safety. Agencies will continue to step up checks on F&amp;B outlets and pivoted nightlife establishments to ensure that VDS and SMMs are strictly adhered to. Firm enforcement action will be taken against operators and individuals who do not comply with SMMs, including the proper wearing of masks. Enforcement action includes prosecution and revocation of licences for food, public entertainment, and liquor.

**Enhanced Measures in Run-up to Deepavali**

6 The Government has put in place additional safety measures in Little India as more visitors are expected in the run-up to Deepavali on 4 November 2021. Some of these measures include switching off the popular pedestrian crossing at the junction of Campbell Lane and Serangoon Road, redirecting pedestrian traffic to two other crossings at Sungei Road and Dunlop Street, and ensuring that businesses do not extend their wares onto the pedestrian walkways, in order to prevent crowding. Some businesses in Little India will extend their operating hours, to allow shoppers to spread out their visits and prevent overcrowding. Relevant Government agencies will also step up enforcement presence in Little India ahead of the Deepavali festivities.

7 We urge everyone to exercise socially responsible behaviour to protect their own health and that of others. Visitors are reminded to remain vigilant, observe SMMs, and visit Little India during off-peak hours where possible. Seniors are urged to stay home, avoid crowded places, and go out only for essential activities over the next few weeks. Those who feel unwell or are sick should seek medical attention and stay home.
