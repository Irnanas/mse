#### Press Release for Enforcement of Safe Distancing Measures in Public Spaces in HDB Estates to Curb COVID-19 Transmission  

1 The Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) on COVID-19 had announced, on 3 April 2020, an elevated set of safe distancing measures to pre-empt the trend of increasing local transmission of COVID-19. These measures aim to reduce movements and interactions in public and private places more significantly and will be in place from 7 April 2020 until 4 May 2020 (inclusive).  

2 The Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR), together with relevant agencies [1], will be **deploying Safe Distancing and SG Clean Ambassadors, and Enforcement Officers (EOs) in HDB estates across Singapore to encourage and enforce safe distancing for the duration of the elevated safe distancing measures.** They will discourage loitering and gatherings in public spaces; no eating and drinking in eating places; as well as ensure safe distancing in queues, through the issuing of advisories and enforcement actions.  

**Safe Distancing Measures in Public Spaces**  

3 During this period, the public is strongly advised to be socially responsible by complying with the following safe distancing measures:  

- **Stay at home.** Do not go out unless you need to, e.g., see a doctor, or buy food and essential items. Go home as soon as you are done.  

- **Limit social contact to household members.** Stay in touch with other family members and friends through video or phone calls.  

- **Do not gather in groups,** either at home or outside, including in the neighbourhood.  

- **Keep a safe distance** of at least 1 metre from others even in open spaces, e.g. in queues, and when exercising.  

- **No eating or drinking in eating places.** Bring a clean container to pack your food for takeout, or opt for delivery.

4 **Members of public are to comply with the elevated safe distancing measures in the common property of public and private housing estates, parks and other shared spaces.** Non-compliance is an offence. Enforcement officers from the Agencies will be conducting compliance inspections and stern actions will be taken against any member of public found in breach of safe distancing measures.  

**Social Responsibility as First Line of Defence against COVID-19**  

5 Singapore is at a critical stage in our fight against COVID-19. To effectively contain the spread of the virus, everyone must exercise social responsibility. It is important to adopt safe distancing and good hygiene practices even at home, and to encourage friends and family to do the same. We all have to play our part. Our collective efforts will go a long way in curbing the spread of COVID-19.
