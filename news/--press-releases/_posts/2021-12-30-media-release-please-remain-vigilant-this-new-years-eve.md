****Please Remain Vigilant and Avoid Crowded Places This New Year&#39;s Eve****

_11 F&amp;B Outlets and 72 Individuals Penalised for Breaching Safe Management Measures During Stepped-up Enforcement Checks_

**30 December 2021** – As we prepare to welcome the new year amidst the spread of the Omicron variant, we strongly urge everyone to avoid crowded places and enjoy the New Year&#39;s Eve celebration from home. There will be no fireworks at this year&#39;s New Year&#39;s Eve countdown celebration at Marina Bay to minimise crowding. Instead, fireworks will be set off from heartland locations across Singapore, so that members of the public can enjoy the fireworks from the safety of their homes. On 31 December 2021, the People&#39;s Association Grassroots Organisations will be organising virtual year-end countdown community programmes to connect residents in a safe way.


2 All over the world, particularly in the US, UK and Europe, we have seen a huge spike in Omicron cases. Please do not let our guard down but remain vigilant, exercise social responsibility, and observe the prevailing safe management measures (SMMs). This is to protect your own health and that of your family and friends.


3 In the past week, government agencies have stepped up enforcement checks. 11 food and beverage (F&amp;B) premises and 72 individuals were penalised for breaching SMMs and Vaccination Differentiated SMMs (VDS). Agencies will continue to step up enforcement at F&amp;B outlets in the year-end period.


**Breaches at F&amp;B Premises and Other Public Spaces**


4 Ten F&amp;B outlets were ordered to close for breaches of SMMs, such as failing to minimise interaction between staff and diners, failing to ensure that groups of diners did not exceed the maximum permitted group size, and allowing diners to consume alcohol after 10.30 pm.


5 One other F&amp;B outlet was issued a composition fine for failing to ensure a safe distance of at least 1 metre between seated customers. Please refer to **Annex A** for details of offences, and **Annex B** for photos.


6 72 individuals were fined for breaches of SMMs and VDS such as gathering in groups larger than the permitted size and mask-related offences.


7 Strict compliance with SMMs is critical for everyone&#39;s safety. During the year-end festive period, agencies will continue stepped-up checks on F&amp;B outlets to ensure that SMMs are strictly adhered to. Firm enforcement action will be taken against operators and individuals who do not comply with SMMs, including the proper wearing of masks. Enforcement action includes prosecution and the revocation of licences.


**Advisory at Parks and Beaches**


8 All campsites and barbecue pits in NParks-managed parks and gardens remain closed. NParks will temporarily close access to some parks, sections of lawns, and facilities – such as lawns, hard courts, shelters, and car parks – when these areas get too crowded or where users remain non-compliant with SMMs. This is necessary to ensure that the parks remain safe for everyone.


9      Members of the public are advised to check the Safe Distance @ Parks portal (safedistparks.nparks.gov.sg) for the latest updates on visitorship levels before heading to parks. We request all park visitors to be socially responsible and observe SMMs. These include keeping to the permitted group size and wearing a mask except when engaging in strenuous exercises or consuming food, drink, or medication.
