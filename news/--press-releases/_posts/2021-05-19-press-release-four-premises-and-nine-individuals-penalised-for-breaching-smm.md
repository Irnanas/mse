#### Four Premises and Nine Individuals Penalised for Breaching Safe Management Measures; Members of Public Urged to Comply with Tightened Measures under Phase 2 (Heightened Alert)

In the run-up to implementation of Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) which started on Sunday 16 May, government agencies have continued with stepped-up enforcement checks on food and beverage (F&B) premises and other public spaces over the past weekend as part of measures to curb the community transmission of COVID-19. Two F&B premises have been ordered to close. Another two F&B outlets have been issued composition fines for breaching Safe Management Measures (SMMs). Nine individuals have also been issued fines for breaching SMMs in parks and beaches.

**Two premises ordered to close**

2 Details of the offences committed at premises that were ordered to close are as below. The closure orders will take effect when dining-in is allowed to resume:

1. **HooHa Restaurant & Cafe** (3 South Buona Vista Road, Viva Vista, B1-06/#B1-11/#B1-50 Singapore 118136) allowed customers to consume alcohol after 10.30pm on 14 May 2021 and provided card games and music entertainment. As this is its third offence, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) has ordered the establishment to close for 30 days.

2. **Darts Legend** (29 Media Circle, Alice @ Mediapolis, #01-01, Singapore 138565) allowed darts to be played on a dart machine on 14 May 2021. As this is its second offence, SFA has ordered the establishment to close for 20 days.

**Fines issued to two outlets**

3 Two F&B outlets were fined $1,000 each for breaching SMMs such as failing to maintain safe distancing between patrons (see Annex A).

**Enforcement against nine individuals for SMM breaches at parks and beaches**

4 Nine individuals were fined for gathering in groups of more than two on 16 May 2021 in parks and beaches managed by the National Parks Board (NParks).

5 In line with the tightened SMMs to reduce interactions in the community, all water play areas and water recreational facilities in NParks-managed parks and gardens will continue to be closed until 13 June 2021. NParks will temporarily close access to some parks, and sections of beaches, lawns, and facilities, such as shelters and car parks, when these areas get too crowded, to ensure that safe distancing can be observed. These areas will be reopened when they are less crowded.

6 Members of the public are advised to check the Safe Distance @ Parks portal (safedistparks.nparks.gov.sg) for the latest updates on visitorship levels before heading to parks. We request all park visitors to be socially responsible and to keep our green spaces safe for everyone. Visitors should observe SMMs such as wearing a mask except when engaging in strenuous exercises or consuming food, drink or medication, as well as keeping to groups of up to two persons. The public can refer to the NParks website for the latest advisories for gardens, parks and nature reserves in response to the COVID-19 situation.

**Members of Public Urged to Adhere to Restrictions under Phase 2 (Heightened Alert)**

7 The number of locally transmitted COVID-19 cases and unlinked community cases continue to be of concern. Members of the public and premises owners are urged to adhere to the restrictions announced under Phase 2 (Heightened Alert), so that we can effectively curb the transmission of cases in the community. We must continue to be vigilant to keep Singapore safe. We seek everyone's cooperation to remain socially responsible and unwavering in our fight against COVID-19.
