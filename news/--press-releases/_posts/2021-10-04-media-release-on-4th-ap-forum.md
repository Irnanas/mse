Singapore, 4 October 2021 – Dr Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment, will be attending the 4th Forum of Ministers and Environment Authorities of Asia Pacific (AP Forum) in Suwon City, Republic of Korea (ROK), from 4 to 8 October 2021. Dr Khor is attending the Forum at the invitation of ROK Environment Minister Han Jeoung-ae. 

2 The AP Forum is a key regional platform under the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). It brings together governments, businesses, scientists, academia, NGOs, and UN agencies to discuss key regional environmental issues and innovations which can be brought to the United Nations Environment Assembly, the world’s highest-level decision-making body on the environment. 

3 At the 4th AP Forum, which is themed “Strengthening Nature Actions to Achieve the Sustainable Development Goals”, Dr Khor will contribute to discussions on sustainable recovery towards achievement of the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development. She will meet ROK counterparts and officials from the Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, and Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Rural Affairs, to learn from the experience of the ROK as well as explore opportunities to enhance bilateral cooperation on sustainability and environment issues.

4 The last AP Forum was hosted by Singapore from 23 to 25 January 2019. As the current Chairman of the AP Forum, Singapore will hand over leadership of the next term to the ROK at the upcoming session.
