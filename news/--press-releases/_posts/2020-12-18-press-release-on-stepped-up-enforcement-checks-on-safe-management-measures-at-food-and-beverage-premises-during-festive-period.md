#### Stepped-up Enforcement Checks on Safe Management Measures at Food and Beverage Premises During Festive Period  

From this weekend and over the next few weeks, government agencies will be stepping up enforcement checks at Food and Beverage (F&B) outlets to ensure compliance with Safe Management Measures (SMMs).  

2 While we recognise that many may wish to meet up with family and friends during the festive period or visit popular areas such as Orchard Road, F&B outlets and members of the public must continue to take SMMs seriously, as dining out is an activity that involves considerable risks. Firm enforcement action will be taken if breaches are found.  

3 Under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020, social gatherings in groups of more than five outside an individualâ€™s residence are prohibited in Phase Two. F&B outlets are not allowed to accept bookings from groups that are larger than five, even if such groups are split across multiple tables. Intermingling between groups is also prohibited. In addition, alcohol should not be served or consumed at F&B premises past 10.30pm. **F&B outlets and patrons are reminded that the current group size limit of five persons will apply until Phase Three takes effect from 28 December 2020.**  

4 COVID-19 remains a grave threat and we must remain vigilant even during the festive period. The Government will not hesitate to take strong enforcement action against operators and individuals who treat SMMs with flagrant disregard. Errant operators and individuals will face fines, temporary closure, and prosecution to the full extent of the law.
