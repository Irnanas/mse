**9 F&amp;B Outlets Penalised for Breaching Safe Management Measures During Stepped-up Enforcement Checks Over the Weekend**

_Operators and members of the public reminded to observe safe management measures for the year-end period_

Nine food and beverage (F&amp;B) premises have been penalised for breaching safe management measures (SMMs) following stepped-up enforcement checks by government agencies over the last weekend. Agencies will continue to step up enforcement at F&amp;B outlets as we approach the year-end period.

**Breaches at F&amp;B Premises**

2 Seven F&amp;B outlets were ordered to close for SMMs and Vaccination Differentiated SMMs (VDS) breaches such as failing to minimise interaction between staff and customers, and failing to put in place a system to perform checks on the vaccination status of patrons before their entry.

3 Two other F&amp;B outlets were issued composition fines for committing SMMs breaches. These included failing to ensure a safe distance of at least 1 metre between seated customers, and failing to ensure SafeEntry check-in by every customer entering the premises. Please refer to **Annex A** for details of offences, and **Annex B** for photos.

4 Strict compliance with SMMs (including VDS) is critical for everyone&#39;s safety, particularly amid the global risk of the Omicron variant. During the year-end festive period, agencies will continue to step up checks on F&amp;B outlets to ensure that VDS and SMMs are strictly adhered to. Firm enforcement action will be taken against operators and individuals who do not comply with SMMs, including the proper wearing of masks. Enforcement action includes prosecution and the revocation of licences.

**Staying Vigilant During the Year-End Period**

5 As we spend time with loved ones and friends this festive period, we urge everyone to take individual responsibility and exercise socially responsible behaviour. This is to protect their own health and that of others, amid the emerging threat of the Omicron variant. Please remain vigilant, observe SMMs, and avoid hotspots where possible. Seniors are urged to stay home, avoid crowded places, and go out only for essential activities over the next few weeks. Those who feel unwell or are sick should seek medical attention and stay home.
