#### Singapore launches National Action Strategy on Marine Litter    

**5 JUNE 2022** – The Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) has launched an inaugural National Action Strategy on Marine Litter (NASML), which aims to galvanise a whole-of-nation effort to combat marine litter. This was announced by Mr Desmond Tan, Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment, during a beach clean-up at Tanah Merah Beach earlier today. The clean-up was organised by social enterprises Stridy and Seastainable, in conjunction with the World Environment Day. 

2 Marine litter is a growing global challenge that requires collective and comprehensive action. It can come from many sources and is a transboundary issue as litter is moved across the oceans by prevailing winds and tides. As a responsible global citizen, Singapore recognises that we have a role to play in addressing marine litter. The NASML, which outlines six strategic focus areas tailored to our local context, demonstrates Singapore’s commitment to address marine litter domestically and internationally:

a.	Reduction of land-based sources of litter

b.	Reduction of sea-based sources of litter

c.	Circular economy approach

d.	Research and development

e.	Maintaining and strengthening outreach and stakeholder engagement 

f.	International engagement and collaboration.

3 MSE developed the NASML in close consultation with key stakeholders such as academics, representatives from Institutes of Higher Learning, ground-up organisations, members of the public, and relevant government agencies. Discussions covered the strengths and gaps in Singapore’s current approach to tackling marine litter, and how individuals, organisations and the public sector can collaborate and contribute to improving the situation.

4 The NASML is a first step to formalise our actions as a nation to address marine litter. MSE will continue to work with our 3P – People, Public, Private – partners to co-create sustainable solutions to our environmental challenges. As plastics comprise a major component of marine litter, our efforts to tackle marine litter will also contribute towards global efforts to address plastic pollution.
