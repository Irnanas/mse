#### UPDATE ON ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AND REFRESHER ON WHAT TO DO AND NOT TO DO DURING THE CIRCUIT BREAKER PERIOD  

1 Today was the first day of enforcement after the Singapore Food Agency introduced a mandatory requirement for all personnel engaged in the sale and preparation of food and drinks at all SFA-licensed food establishments to wear masks or other forms of physical barriers (e.g. face shields) [photo in Annex A].  

2 More than 200 composition fines will be issued to members of public who did not comply with elevated safe distancing measures. One of them was an offender who sat down on a marked seat at a food centre at Blk 117 Aljunied Ave 2. Police assistance was required as she refused to leave, continued eating and refused to provide her particulars [photo in Annex B]. In total, Police assistance was required for more than 10 cases today when members of public were not cooperative.  

3 Agencies continued to maintain a strong presence of Enforcement Officers (EOs) and ambassadors today, with over 2,900 deployed altogether. Firm action will continue to be taken for non-compliance. Both yesterday and today, fines have been issued to people who were loitering, or using facilities, playfields and areas that had been cordoned off or closed off. This included a group playing in the Tanjong Rhu open field, a small group playing tennis at the closed Tanglin Tennis Academy, and baseball in a closed private field at Tanglin Rugby Club [photo in Annex C].  

4 Members of the public should take note that EOs are the only officers who can take enforcement against the public for breaches of safe distancing measures. They wear the corporate attire and lanyard of their respective agencies. Any member of public found in breach of measures, including failure or refusal to comply with directions from an EO, will be asked for his/her particulars. First-time offenders face a composition fine of $300. Repeat offenders will face higher fines, or prosecution in court for egregious cases.  

5 EOs will not demand payment of the fine on the spot. Notices will be issued to offenders in hard copy either on site, or through the mail. No immediate payment or handing over of cash is required. Members of public are cautioned against handing over any cash to persons who claim to be Enforcement Officers.  

**DO’S AND DON’TS DURING THE CIRCUIT BREAKER PERIOD**  

6 As we begin the second week of the circuit break period, members of the public are reminded to continue to cooperate with our EOs and Safe Distancing Ambassadors by adhering to the elevated safe distancing measures:  

**S**tay home. Stay safe.  
**A**void gathering with others not from your household, either at home or outside  
**F**irst offence: $300. Repeat offenders: Higher fines, or prosecution in court for egregious cases  
**E**lderly to stay home — they are most vulnerable to COVID-19  
**D**on’t forget to wear a mask when going out, especially to markets and on public transport  
**I**nstead of peak hours, visit markets at non-peak hours on weekends or weekdays  
**S**ocial contact should be limited to household members  
**T**akeout or get your food delivered – no dining-in is allowed at eating places  
**A**ll group recreational activities are not allowed in public spaces. Individuals and members of the same household are allowed to exercise by walking, jogging and cycling.  
**N**o loitering at public spaces. Do not enter closed-off public spaces.  
**C**leanliness and public hygiene are our first line of defence. Wash your hands with soap.
