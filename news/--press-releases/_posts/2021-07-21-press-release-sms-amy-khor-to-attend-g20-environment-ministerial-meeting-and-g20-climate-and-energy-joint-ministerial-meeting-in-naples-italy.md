#### Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment Amy Khor to attend G20 Environment Ministerial Meeting and G20 Climate and Energy Joint Ministerial Meeting in Naples, Italy

1 Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment Amy Khor will be travelling to Naples, Italy, from 21 to 24 July 2021.

2 Dr Khor will represent Singapore at the G20 Environment Ministerial Meeting, and the G20 Climate and Energy Joint Ministerial Meeting in Naples, Italy. Reflecting the urgent need to address global warming and energy issues, this will be the first time the G20 is convening a ministerial meeting to discuss the synergies between the climate and energy sectors. Singapore&#39;s participation at these meetings as a guest country is at the invitation of Italy, which holds the G20 Presidency this year.

3 At the G20 Environment Ministerial Meeting, the Ministers will discuss the G20 Environment Ministerial Communiqué. The Communiqué is expected to underscore the importance of: (i) Biodiversity; (ii) Nature Protection and Ecosystem Restoration; and (iii) Sustainability and Quality of Life; and (iv) Green Finance.

4 The topics discussed at the G20 Climate and Energy Joint Ministerial Meeting include: (i) Smart, Resilient, and Sustainable Cities; (ii) Sustainable Recovery and Clean Energy Transition; and (iii) Green Finance. The Ministers will discuss and adopt a G20 joint Climate-Energy Communiqué.

5 These discussions will feed into the G20 Leaders&#39; Summit held from 30 to 31 October 2021, in Rome, Italy, which will be attended by Heads of State. Singapore looks forward to contributing to G20 discussions on the pressing environmental and climate issues facing the global community today.
