**117 Individuals Penalised for Breaching Safe Management Measures; Hotel Directed to Suspend Bookings as Part of Stepped Up Enforcement Efforts**

_Operators and individuals are reminded to comply with Safe Management Measures at Food and Beverage Establishments and Hotspots_

Since the resumption of dining-in at food and beverage (F&amp;B) premises on 21 June 2021, government agencies have stepped up enforcement at F&amp;B premises and identified hotspots. Bookings at one hotel have been suspended, while 117 individuals have been issued composition fines for breaching Safe Management Measures (SMMs). In the coming weekends, agencies will continue to ramp up checks on F&amp;B premises to ensure that SMMs are strictly observed.

**Hotel suspended for breaching Safe Management Measures in February 2021**

2 On 6 February 2021, Singapore Tourism Board (STB)&#39;s enforcement officers found that 11 individuals had gathered in a hotel room in Orchard Hotel Singapore (442 Orchard Road) for a birthday celebration. This contravened the prevailing SMMs applicable during Phase 3, which stated that hotels must not allow gatherings of more than eight individuals in any guest room, except where the gathering consists wholly of individuals from the same household. (Based on prevailing permissible group size for gatherings under Singapore’s Phase 3 of re-opening from 28 December 2020 to 16 May 2021.)

3 Following investigations, STB issued Orchard Hotel a composition fine of $1,000 and ordered the hotel to suspend room bookings for 30 days from 25 June to 24 July 2021 (both dates inclusive) for failing to comply with SMMs in Phase 3. The hotel will not be permitted to accept new room bookings for the duration of the suspension, but may continue to fulfil existing bookings made prior to the suspension.

4 Further investigations of the individuals involved are ongoing, and enforcement action may be taken against them. STB will continue to conduct regular checks and take strict enforcement action against any breaches by hotels and individuals.

**117 individuals** **fined since the start of Phase 3 (Heightened Alert) for breaches at parks and beaches**

5 Since the start of Phase 3 (Heightened Alert) on 14 June 2021, 117 individuals have been issued fines for breaching SMMs in parks and beaches managed by the National Parks Board (NParks). These breaches include not wearing masks when not engaging in strenuous exercises, and gathering in groups larger than the permitted size. For example, a group of 17 individuals and a group of 13 individuals were caught gathering in Changi Beach Park and East Coast Park respectively. In addition, around 1,800 advisories were issued to individuals for breaches.

6 **All water play areas, water recreational facilities, campsites and barbecue pits in NParks-managed parks and gardens will remain closed until further notice.** NParks will temporarily close access to some parks, sections of beaches, lawns, and facilities – such as hard courts, shelters and car parks – when these areas get too crowded or where people remain non-compliant with SMMs, to ensure that the parks remain safe for everyone.

7 Members of the public are advised to check the Safe Distance @ Parks portal (safedistparks.nparks.gov.sg) for the latest updates on visitorship levels before heading to parks. We request all park visitors to be socially responsible and observe SMMs such as keeping to the permitted group size, and to wear a mask except when engaging in strenuous exercises or consuming food, drink or medication, to keep our green spaces safe for everyone. The public can refer to the NParks website for the latest advisories for gardens, parks and nature reserves in response to the COVID-19 situation.

**Everyone strongly advised to comply with SMMs**

8 As Singapore reopens safely, we urge everyone to strictly follow all SMMs and practise good hygiene, especially in high-risk settings such as when dining in at F&amp;B establishments, to curb the spread of COVID-19. Agencies will enforce against any breaches of SMMs at these premises and identified hotspots 
on public feedback and ground observations. These include **parks, beaches, and common areas of HDB estates such as hardcourts, basketball courts and pavilions.**

9 First time individual offenders face a composition fine of $300. Repeat offenders will face higher fines, or prosecution in court for egregious cases. **Operators that breach SMMs, including 1 metre safe distancing between groups of diners, face closures, even for first offences.**
