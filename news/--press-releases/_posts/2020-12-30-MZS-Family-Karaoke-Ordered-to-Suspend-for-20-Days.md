#### MZS Family Karaoke ordered to suspend operations for 20 days: 51 individuals found crowding and consuming alcohol after 10.30pm**

As part of the stepped-up enforcement checks at Food and Beverage (F&amp;B) outlets to ensure compliance with Safe Management Measures (SMMs), the Singapore Police Force (SPF) and the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) have commenced investigations on breaches detected on 25 December 2020 at MZS Family Karaoke (Ming Arcade, 21 Cuscaden Road).

2 MZS Family Karaoke was found to have allowed patrons to consume alcohol after 10.30pm. The Police is also investigating 51 individuals for suspected non-compliance with safe distancing measures. Under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020, social gatherings in groups of more than five outside an individual&#39;s residence are prohibited in Phase Two. F&amp;B outlets are also not allowed to accept bookings from groups larger than five, even if such groups were split across multiple tables. Intermingling between groups is also prohibited. In addition, alcohol must not be served or consumed at F&amp;B premises past 10.30pm.

3 For allowing a large gathering and serving alcohol past 10.30pm on the premises, MZS Family Karaoke was ordered to close for a period of 20 days from 25 December 2020 until 13 January 2021 (both dates inclusive). Further investigations are ongoing in respect of possible breaches by various parties. (Photos of breaches in **Annex A** ).

**Fines issued to F&amp;B outlets**

4 Seven more F&amp;Boutlets (listed in **Annex B** ) were fined $1,000 each for breaches of SMMs from 18 to 26 December 2020. These breaches included admitting and seating groups of more than five together, allowing groups to intermingle, seating groups of patrons less than 1 metre apart and providing games to patrons despite not being an amusement centre.

**Safe Management Measures Remain Critical in Phase Three**

5 Under Phase Three, which started on 28 December 2020, social gatherings of up to eight persons are allowed. F&amp;B outlets are reminded not to accept bookings of groups that are larger than eight, even if the diners are seated at separate tables. Similar to Phase Two, intermingling between groups, and the serving and consumption of alcohol after 10.30pm are strictly prohibited. For more information on safe management measures to follow during Phase Three, visit [https://www.gov.sg/article/covid-19-resources#posters](https://www.gov.sg/article/covid-19-resources#posters). Over the coming New Year weekend, agencies will continue to step up enforcement checks on F&amp;B outlets.

6 It is imperative that businesses and members of the public continue to adhere to SMMs to keep community transmission low while we resume activities. Keeping group sizes small and limiting the number of contacts slow down the rate of virus transmission and mitigate the risks of super-spreading events and formation of large clusters. Wearing masks and observing good hygiene are also key to impeding the spread of the virus.

7 To reduce the risk of crowds gathering at _Marina Bay on New Year&#39;s Eve_, there will be no fireworks display in the precinct. Instead, fireworks will be set off from different heartland locations across Singapore, bringing the countdown experience closer to Singaporeans at home. We urge Singaporeans to enjoy the heartland fireworks, the Marina Bay _Shine a Light_ display and _Share the Moment_ light projections online and on MediaCorp Channel 5 in the comfort of their homes. Singaporeans are also encouraged to join in the community year-end countdown programmes online. SMMs and crowd control measures will be in place at the fireworks sites to ensure public safety, and Safe Distancing Ambassadors will be deployed to remind members of the public not to gather at the respective sites. We urge Singaporeans to practise social responsibility and cooperate with our officers to ensure the continued safety and well-being of the community.
