####  Singapore signs extension of MOU with United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organization to continue collaboration on food security and safety  

18 September 2021 – Singapore and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) signed a second extension of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on food security and safety today.

2	The extension of the MOU was signed by Dr Amy Khor, Singapore’s Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment, and Dr Qu Dongyu, Director General of FAO, on the sidelines of the G20 Agriculture Ministers Meeting 2021 in Florence, Italy. Mr Lim Kok Thai, Chief Executive Officer of the Singapore Food Agency, was also present. 

3	Under the extension, both parties will continue to work together to improve food security and safety for an additional period of three years. The cooperation will focus on strengthening food safety and risk assessment to safeguard the health of consumers, as well as addressing antimicrobial resistance and exploring urban food solutions. 

4	The MOU was signed between Singapore and the FAO in 2015 and was first extended in 2018 for a three-year period, until 2021. Since the MOU was signed, Singapore has worked with the FAO to organise capacity and capability building workshops for the ASEAN region. These workshops facilitated the sharing of knowledge and expertise on food safety, fisheries, and tackling antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Most recently, a workshop was held earlier this year to develop the ASEAN 5-year Regional Plan of Action on AMR in aquaculture.

5	Dr Khor said, “Strengthening the resilience and sustainability of the food system remains a priority for countries around the world, in the face of challenges such as climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic. Singapore has a strong partnership with FAO and we look forward to continue working closely together to build capability and knowledge to enhance global food security and safety.”
