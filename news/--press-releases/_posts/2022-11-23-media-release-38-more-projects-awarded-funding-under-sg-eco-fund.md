description: 38 More Projects Awarded Funding under SG Eco Fund’s Sprout Category
---

**Singapore, 23 November 2022** – A total of 38 more projects will obtain funding under the Sprout category of the SG Eco Fund. The applications were submitted by 31 August 2022, following the launch of SG Eco Fund’s third grant call on 1 May 2022.

2	The projects were selected from 55 applications and will receive funding of about S$283,500 in total. Please refer to the **Annex** for the full list of the awarded projects.

3	Image Mission’s “Sew Can I” is one of the 38 awarded projects under the Sprout category of the SG Eco Fund. The project builds on the non-profit’s mission to empower women from disadvantaged backgrounds by teaching them to upcycle clothing donations into useful items like bags and household items.

4	Another awarded project is an environmental education campaign to raise awareness amongst homeowners about the effects of excessive fast furniture. The project is run by a group of final-year undergraduates from the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information at Nanyang Technological University.

5	Mr Baey Yam Keng, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and the Environment, said: “Building a green, liveable and climate-resilient Singapore requires the collective efforts of all stakeholders. I am encouraged that more individuals and community groups have come forward with their sustainability ideas through the SG Eco Fund. We hope to empower more people to take ownership of environmental projects while also encouraging them to think creatively about how they can contribute towards our Singapore Green Plan 2030.”

6 The S$50 million SG Eco Fund was launched in November 2020 by the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment. The Fund supports ground-up projects that involve the community and advance environmental sustainability in Singapore, including climate change mitigation, waste reduction, as well as the conservation of nature and biodiversity. To date, 105 projects across the private, public and people sectors have been awarded a total of over $6.6 million in funding.

7	The Sprout category was introduced last year to simplify and shorten the application and evaluation processes for projects seeking funding of up to S$10,000. Instead of a written proposal, applicants with Sprout projects only need to submit a pitch deck and present it to the evaluation committee if shortlisted. 

8	Applications for the Sprout category of the SG Eco Fund are open year-round and will be evaluated in batches throughout the year. The next round of evaluation will be for all applications received by 31 Dec 2022.

9	Interested applicants can find out more about the SG Eco Fund at https://www.mse.gov.sg/sgecofund.
