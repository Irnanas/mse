#### Enforcement Action Taken Against 131 Individuals and 12 Food and Beverage Premises for Breaching Safe Management Measures; Advisory for Upcoming Festive Period


29 January 2021 – As part of stepped-up inspections to ensure compliance with Safe Management Measures (SMMs), government agencies conducted enhanced checks on food and beverage (F&B) premises, malls and other public spaces on 22 and 23 January 2021. Four F&B outlets have been ordered to close, while six outlets and 131 individuals were fined for breaching SMMs.

**Four F&B outlets ordered to close**  

2	Details of the offences committed at the F&B outlets, and the orders for closure are as follows (photos in Annex A):

a) **Xiao Yao Ge** (350 Jurong East Avenue 1, #01-2227) was found to have committed a third offence of seating different groups of diners less than 1 metre apart on 23 January 2021. The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) has issued an order requiring the operator to close for a period of 10 days from 28 January to 6 February 2021 (both dates inclusive). 

b) **Main Entrance** (40 Sago Street) was found to have allowed a gathering of more than eight individuals, failed to conduct temperature checks at the entrance, and allowed customers to make speeches on 23 January 2021. Under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020, F&B establishments must not allow any speeches or recitals by customers. The Singapore Tourism Board (STB) has issued an order requiring the operator to close for a period of 10 days from 26 January to 4 February 2021 (both dates inclusive).

c) My Heritage Food and Beverage Trading, trading as **Killiney Kopitiam** (#01-10 Lucky Plaza), failed to conduct temperature checks at the entrance and to ensure its customers performed SafeEntry check-ins for contact tracing on 26 January 2021. STB has issued an order requiring the operator to close for a period of 10 days from 27 January to 5 February 2021 (both dates inclusive). The establishment was previously issued composition fines of $1,000 on 3 August 2020 and $2,000 on 2 November 2020 for similar infringements. 

d) **Tian Ya Hai Jiao KTV** (2 Aliwal Street, #03-01), which had received approval to pivot their operations to F&B, was found to be serving alcohol to diners past 10.30pm on 10 January 2021. The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has issued an order requiring the operator to close the premises for a period of 10 days from 23 January to 1 February 2021 (both dates inclusive).  

**Fines Issued to Six F&B Outlets and 27 Individuals**

5	URA has filed charges against two more F&B operators, **Mark Enterprise Pte Ltd** and **Kim’s Place Seafood Restaurant Pte Ltd**, for breaches under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020. Both operators will be charged in Court on 2 February 2021. **Invincible (BBCM) Pte Ltd**, which URA had filed charges against last month, will be charged in Court on the same day.

6	Mark Enterprise Pte Ltd (operator of Try Again at 17 Circular Road) had allegedly continued business operations on 18 July 2020 despite being issued an order to close its premises for a period of 10 days from 18 to 27 July 2020 (both dates inclusive) for multiple SMM infringements previously.

7	Charges were also filed against Kim’s Place Seafood Restaurant Pte Ltd (operator of Kim’s Place Seafood at 45 Joo Chiat Place) and **Singapore Straits Wine Company Pte Ltd**. Kim’s Place Seafood allegedly allowed gatherings of more than five persons split across multiple tables. It also allowed karaoke activities on its premises on 7 and 12 September 2020. For the breaches, the operator was also issued two closure orders totaling 30 days, from 6 January to 4 February 2021. Singapore Straits Wine Company allegedly organised a company gathering at Kim’s Place Seafood on 7 September 2020, which involved 26 staff. The 26 individuals have each been fined $300. 

**Enforcement Against SMM Breaches by Individuals at Parks and Beaches**
 
8	104 individuals were fined for breaching SMMs on 23 and 24 January 2021 in parks and beaches managed by the National Parks Board (NParks). These breaches included gathering in groups of more than eight people and intermingling. In Changi Beach Park alone, 27 individuals were each fined $300 for breaching SMMs on the two days (photo in Annex A).  NParks will continue to step up enforcement at our parks and beaches.

**Advisory for Upcoming Festive Period**

9	Increased social intermingling during festive periods heightens the risks of COVID-19 transmission. In recent weeks, we have already seen the re-emergence of clusters in the local community. Last year, we saw the emergence of large COVID-19 clusters stemming from Chinese New Year gatherings. The increase in social activities during the Christmas and year-end period had likely contributed to the recent number of community cases. 

10	It is critical that members of the public stay vigilant, follow the rules and continue to observe SMMs to prevent a resurgence of community transmission. We must not jeopardise the progress that we have made thus far. While many may wish to dine out with family and friends during the upcoming festive period, or visit popular areas such as shopping malls, F&B outlets and parks, members of the public must continue to take SMMs seriously. We all have to play our part so that the sacrifices we have made will not be in vain. 

11	As announced by the Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) on 22 January 2021, households are limited to eight unique visitors a day.  Individuals should also limit themselves to visiting at most two other households per day. For the tossing of yusheng, masks must be worn and the lo hei should be done without any verbalisation of the auspicious phrases or toasting. 

12	Multiple table bookings at F&B premises for groups larger than eight persons are strictly prohibited, unless the diners are from the same household. Intermingling across different tables is not allowed. In the run-up to the festive period, there are already anecdotal reports of F&B outlets accepting bookings for large groups and breaking them into smaller tables, and diners making bookings for large groups under different names. We strongly advise F&B operators to double-check the reservations they have already received to ensure that the bookings are in order. We also urge diners to not try to circumvent the rules, for the sake of their loved ones and the well-being of the community.

13	Agencies are already stepping up enforcement inspections, including checking the bookings made at F&B outlets, and will continue to do so during the festive period. We will not hesitate to take firm enforcement action against operators and diners. This includes fines, suspension of operations even for first offences, and prosecution for egregious breaches.
