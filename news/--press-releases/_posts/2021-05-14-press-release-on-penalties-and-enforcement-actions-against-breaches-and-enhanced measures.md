#### 30 Premises and 30 Individuals Penalised for Breaching Safe Management Measures; Enhanced Measures for Nightlife Operators which have Pivoted to F&B Industry 

**14 May 2021** – In the first week of tightened measures to curb the community transmission of COVID-19, government agencies have continued with stepped-up enforcement checks on food and beverage (F&B) premises and other public spaces. Ten F&B premises have been ordered to close, of which six are former nightlife establishments which have pivoted to the F&B industry. Another 20 F&B outlets have been issued composition fines for breaching Safe Management Measures (SMMs). A total of 30 individuals have also been issued fines for breaching SMMs in parks and beaches.

2 As egregious breaches of SMMs have been committed in recent months at former nightlife establishments which have pivoted to the F&B industry, agencies have enhanced administrative and enforcement measures for such establishments. These measures are intended to ensure that the operators run F&B businesses which comply with SMMs. The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) will continue to make available grants to support nightlife operators wishing to pivot to F&B operations or to exit from the industry up till 30 September 2021. 
 
**Enhanced measures for pivoted nightlife establishments to ensure SMM compliance** 

3 Pubs, bars, nightclubs, discotheques and karaoke lounges (collectively known as “nightlife establishments”) have not been allowed to operate in their original form since March 2020, as the nature of their activities pose a significantly higher risk of COVID-19 transmission. To support nightlife establishments amidst this prolonged closure, a process was put in place since October 2020 to allow operators to temporarily pivot to F&B businesses. To date, 406 nightlife operators have received the Singapore Food Agency’s (SFA) foodshop or snack counter licence and temporarily pivoted to F&B operations. Many of these establishments have successfully pivoted towards F&B operations in accordance with the requirements.

4 However, despite only being allowed to conduct F&B operations, some establishments continue to operate usual nightlife activities which are currently prohibited, and have flagrantly flouted SMMs in the process. These SMM breaches include failing to prevent large groups of patrons from intermingling, employing hostesses, and allowing live entertainment (e.g. live singing and dancing, playing of musical instruments) and games (e.g. dice and billiards). The vast majority of repeated egregious breaches have been committed by recently pivoted nightlife establishments (see Annex B). Examples of egregious breaches can be found in Annex C. 

5 As SMM breaches committed by this group of establishments are flagrant and carry much higher public health risks, agencies will adopt enhanced measures to take effective action against egregious breaches committed by non-compliant pivoted establishments, as follows:   

a)	**With effect from this month, SFA will start to revoke the food licences of non-compliant ex-nightlife operators in the F&B industry which are found to commit egregious breaches of SMMs.** Establishments which lose their food license must cease operations with immediate effect until the nightlife sector is allowed to reopen in future, or until their re-application for a new food licence is approved.  

b)	**With immediate effect, nightlife operators intending to operate F&B establishments must file a Change of Use application with the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA),** to obtain planning permission to convert the premises into an F&B establishment. Applicants will be required to submit proposed business concept/operational details (e.g. food and drinks menu) and a layout plan showing the usage of the proposed F&B establishment premises (e.g. including dining spaces and kitchen), as well as plans to remove any bar-related signages or paraphernalia, for URA’s assessment. SFA will only proceed to process the foodshop licence application upon URA’s approval for the premises to be converted. 

While URA had earlier provided endorsements to facilitate nightlife operators to temporarily pivot to F&B operations, these operators must now apply for Change of Use by the end of the one-year validity of these endorsements, should they intend to continue to operate an F&B business. Nightlife establishments may continue to apply for a grant of up to $50,000 from Enterprise Singapore (ESG) to defray qualifying costs incurred during the COU process. This support is available up to 30 September 2021. Operators may reach out to the Singapore Nightlife Business Association at helpdesk@snba.org.sg for more information.

c)	Agencies will also take other enforcement measures on operators within their regulatory ambit. This includes the **revoking of the Public Entertainment Licence or Liquor Licence.** Under such circumstances, operators will not possess a valid licence to reopen, provide public entertainment, and/or sell liquor even when there is a class resumption of the nightlife sector.

6 SMMs must be strictly adhered to by premises owners and individuals; otherwise we could well face a resurgence of community transmission which will disrupt our lives and livelihoods. We have seen how nightlife activities in other countries have led to super spreader events. We must all do our part to prevent this from occurring in Singapore. The resurgent waves of widespread infection in overseas countries are sobering reminders of the potentially devastating threat posed by the pandemic. We must continue to be vigilant to keep Singapore safe. We seek everyone’s cooperation to remain socially responsible and unwavering in our fight against COVID-19.

**Fines issued to 20 outlets** 

8 A total of 17 F&B outlets were fined $1,000 each for breaching SMMs. Breaches included seating groups of customers less than 1 metre apart, not ensuring queueing customers were more than 1 metre apart, playing videos for customers, and providing dice games. Three outlets were fined $2,000 each for repeated offences of seating groups of customers less than 1 metre apart, playing videos for customers, providing dice games and poker cards, and providing self-service buffet (see Annex A).

**Enforcement against individuals for SMM breaches at parks and beaches**

9 A total of 30 individuals were fined for breaching SMMs on 8 and 9 May 2021 in parks and beaches managed by the National Parks Board (NParks). These breaches include gathering in groups of more than five.

10 In line with the tightened SMMs to reduce the level of interactions in the community, all water play areas and water recreational facilities in NParks-managed parks and gardens will be closed from 8 to 30 May. In addition, NParks will temporarily close access to some parks, and sections of beaches and facilities, such as shelters and car parks, when these areas get too crowded, to ensure that safe distancing can be observed. These areas will be reopened when they are less crowded.

11 Before heading down to parks, please check the Safe Distance @ Parks portal (safedistparks.nparks.gov.sg) for the latest updates on visitorship levels. We request all park visitors to be socially responsible and to keep our green spaces safe for everyone. Visitors should observe SMMs such as wearing a mask except when engaging in strenuous exercises or consuming food, drink or medication, as well as keeping to groups of up to five people. The public can refer to the NParks website for the latest advisories for gardens, parks and nature reserves in response to the COVID-19 situation.

**Investigations ongoing for abuse against safe distancing personnel at Lau Pa Sat**

12 On 8 May 2021, Safe Distancing Enforcement Officers (SDEOs) and a Safe Distancing Ambassador (SDA) from the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) spotted a group of six diners sitting across two tables of three after entering Lau Pa Sat. Social gatherings are currently limited to a group size of up to five persons, and the group did not comply with this measure. When advised of the measure, two men from the group used abusive language against the officers. The Police were called in for assistance and the case is currently under investigation. 

13 The Government takes a serious view of abuse of safe distancing personnel and will not hesitate to take firm action against those who do so. SDEOs and SDAs have been working hard to keep our community safe. They are performing an important duty. We urge members of the public to continue to cooperate with them and comply with the instructions of personnel deployed for COVID-19-related duties.
