**Singapore, 30 August 2022** â€“ Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, Ms Grace Fu, will be travelling to Bali, Indonesia, from 30 August to 2 September 2022 to represent Singapore at the G20 Joint Environment and Climate Ministers' Meeting (JECMM).

2 This is the first time the G20 is convening a ministerial-level meeting to discuss both the environment and climate sectors, and their interlinkages. This recognises the growing importance of global environmental and climate change challenges. Singapore is participating in these meetings as a guest country at the invitation of Indonesia, which holds the G20 Presidency this year.

3 At the G20 JECMM, the Ministers will discuss and seek to adopt a G20 Joint Environment and Climate Communique to underscore the group's commitment towards a stronger, and more inclusive and sustainable global recovery, and to enhance and mobilise efforts to achieve our collective environmental and climate objectives.

4 These discussions and outcomes will feed into the G20 Leaders' Summit, which will be held in Bali, Indonesia, from 15 to 16 November 2022. Singapore looks forward to contributing to the G20 discussions on ways to address the pressing environmental and climate issues facing the global community today.

5 Minister Fu will be accompanied by officials from the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, and the Prime Minister's Office.
