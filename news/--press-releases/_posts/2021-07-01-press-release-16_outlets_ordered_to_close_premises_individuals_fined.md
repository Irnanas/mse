**16 F&B Outlets Ordered to Close; 13 other Premises and 14 Individuals Fined for Breaching Safe Management Measures**

_Agencies will continue with stringent enforcement in coming weeks_

1 Following stepped-up enforcement checks over the past week, 16 Food and Beverage (F&B) premises have been ordered to close, while 13 F&B outlets and 14 individuals have been issued composition fines for breaching Safe Management Measures (SMMs). More than 1,500 advisories were also issued to individuals for breaching SMMs at parks and beaches. Members of the public and operators are urged to adhere strictly to SMMs as agencies will continue with stringent enforcement checks over the coming weeks, even as we gradually open up Singapore.  

2	16 premises were ordered to close for breaches such as allowing groups of more than two individuals from different households to be seated across multiple tables, allowing more than two individuals to be seated at the same table, permitting intermingling between groups, and multiple failures to ensure patrons across tables were seated at least 1 metre apart. Please refer to _**Annex A**_ for details of the offences committed at premises that were ordered to close, and _**Annex B**_ for photos. 

**Fines issued to 13 outlets and 14 individuals for SMM breaches**

3	10 premises were fined $1,000 each for breaching SMMs. Breaches included seating groups of customers less than 1 metre apart and playing loud music for customers. Three were fined $2,000 each for repeated offences of seating groups of customers less than 1 metre apart and playing loud music as a form of entertainment. Please refer to _**Annex C**_ for the list of outlets. 

4	14 individuals were fined $300 each for gathering in groups larger than two while in an F&B outlet and for failing to wear a mask when they were not eating or drinking.

**Update on Orchard Hotel SMM breach**

5 The Singapore Tourism Board (STB) has concluded investigations against 11 individuals who gathered in a room in Orchard Hotel for a birthday celebration in February 2021. The 11 individuals have been issued composition fines of $300 each for gathering in a group larger than the permitted group size, which was eight at the time of the offence.  

6	STB will continue to conduct regular checks and take strict enforcement action against any breaches by both hotels and guests.

**SMM breaches at parks and beaches**

7	More than 1,500 advisories were issued to individuals for breaching SMMs from 25 to 27 June 2021 in parks and beaches managed by the National Parks Board (NParks). These breaches included not wearing masks when not engaging in strenuous exercises and gathering in groups larger than the permitted group size. 

8	All water play areas, water recreational facilities, campsites and barbecue pits in NParks-managed parks and gardens will remain closed until further notice. NParks will temporarily close access to some parks, sections of beaches, lawns, and facilities – such as hard courts, shelters and car parks – when these areas get too crowded or where people remain non-compliant with SMMs, to ensure that the parks remain safe for everyone.

9	Members of the public are advised to check the Safe Distance @ Parks portal (safedistparks.nparks.gov.sg) for the latest updates on visitorship levels before heading to parks. We request all park visitors to be socially responsible and observe SMMs such as keeping to the permitted group size, and to wear a mask except when engaging in strenuous exercises or consuming food, drink or medication, to keep our green spaces safe for everyone.

**Everyone strongly advised to comply with strict SMMs**

10	Even as we step up the pace of vaccinations in Singapore, we urge everyone to observe all SMMs and practise good hygiene, especially in high-risk settings such as when dining in at F&B establishments, to curb the spread of COVID-19. Agencies will continue to enforce against any breaches at these premises and identified hotspots based on public feedback and ground observations. These include parks, beaches, and common areas of HDB estates such as hardcourts, basketball courts and pavilions.

11	First time individual offenders face a composition fine of $300. Repeat offenders will face higher fines, or prosecution in court for egregious cases. Operators that breach SMMs, including 1 metre safe distancing between groups of diners, face closures, even for first offences.
