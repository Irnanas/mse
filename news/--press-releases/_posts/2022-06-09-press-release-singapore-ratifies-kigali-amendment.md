#### Singapore Ratifies Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol

*Move will reduce Singapore&#39;s greenhouse gas emissions arising from HFC consumption and support our net zero ambition*

**9 June 2022** â€“ Singapore has ratified the Kigali Amendment (KA) to the Montreal Protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support our net zero emissions ambition.

2 Since 1989, Singapore has been a Party to the Montreal Protocol, an international treaty to protect the ozone layer by phasing out the use of ozone-depleting substances. However, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which are substitutes for these ozone-depleting substances, are potent greenhouse gases that contribute significantly to global warming. Hence, the KA to the Montreal Protocol was introduced to reduce the global consumption and production of HFCs.

3 HFCs are commonly used as refrigerants in refrigeration and air-conditioning (RAC) equipment. For example, the typical refrigerant used in chillers has a global warming potential (GWP) of 1,300.

4 Singapore will phase down the consumption of HFCs by 80 per cent over the next two decades to meet the obligations of the KA<sup>1</sup>. The National Environment Agency (NEA) has introduced measures to support the industry to shift towards more climate-friendly alternatives. Since 1 January 2019, HFCs imported into Singapore have been subjected to licensing controls. In 2020, a Low-GWP Refrigerants Chillers (LRC) grant was introduced to support companies that want to make an early switch to climate-friendly water-cooled chillers.

5 In addition, regulations to mitigate HFC emissions will come into effect on 1 October 2022 under the Environmental Protection and Management Act. These regulations aim to shift the market towards more climate-friendly RAC technologies and equipment, require the proper handling of refrigerants during servicing works, and mandate the collection and proper treatment of spent refrigerants from decommissioned RAC equipment.

6 The Government will continue to work closely with industry stakeholders and support them in reducing HFC consumption and shifting towards climate-friendly alternatives.

<sup>1</sup>Under the KA, Parties are obliged to progressively reduce HFC consumption according to a phase-down schedule:

i. From 2024: Freeze at baseline
ii. From 2029: 90% of baseline
iii. From 2035: 70% of baseline
iv. From 2040: 50% of baseline
v. From 2045: 20% of baseline

The baseline is defined as the average HFC consumption over 2020-2022 + 65% hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) baseline.
