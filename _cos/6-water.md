## Improving Water Efficiency

We will continue to encourage water conservation and water efficient practices for industries. From 1 January 2022, the Mandatory Water Efficiency Labelling Scheme (MWELS) will be extended to water-closet flush valves. A minimum 2-tick water efficiency rating will be mandated for the sale and supply of water-closet flush valves in Singapore. Minimum water efficiency requirements will also be mandated for the sale and supply of new commercial equipment, namely washer extractors, dishwashers and high-pressure washers from 1 January 2022. (See Annex F.)
