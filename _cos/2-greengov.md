## Green Government: Public service to peak emissions around 2025

As a small, island city-state with no natural resources, Singapore is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The Government will lead efforts to ensure Singapore remains a green and liveable home by putting sustainability at the core of everything we do. New and ambitious sustainability targets will be set for the public sector. This includes a target to peak our emissions around 2025, ahead of the national target. We will also use tools and levers at our disposal, including procurement, to influence those within and outside of the public service to adopt sustainability practices and to raise awareness.
