## Resilient Future: Moves to protect coastlines, strengthen food security and keep Singapore cool

We will continue to undertake forward planning to adapt to the challenges posed by climate change. Studies to explore measures to protect the coastlines of City-East Coast and Jurong Island will commence this year. PUB will also develop a purpose-built model capable of analysing the combined effects of extreme sea levels and intense rainfall-induced inland floods. This Coastal-Inland Flood Model will enable PUB to holistically assess inland and coastal flood risks.

To further safeguard Singapore’s food security, the agri-food sector will receive enhanced funding support to transform and meet our ’30 by 30’ goal. A $60 million Agri-Food Cluster Transformation (ACT) Fund will be established to support the transformation of the sector into one that is highly productive, climate-resilient and resource-efficient. It will better cater to farms of different scales and developmental needs, and replace the Agriculture Productivity Fund. The Fund will be open for application in April 2021.

The Singapore Food Agency will also partner our aquaculture sector to unlock the potential of sea-based fish farming. SFA will tender out new sea sites on leases and encourage farms to adopt technology for higher productivity and review fish farming practices to enhance business resilience and sustainability over the next few years.

We will mitigate the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect through a three-pronged strategy: (a) Understand the UHI effect better by deploying an island-wide network of climate sensors to collect data; (b) Conduct research and modelling on UHI effects, e.g.  the Cooling Singapore 2.0 project; and (c) Partner the industry and public to implement a UHI mitigation action plan, including piloting the use of cool materials and reducing human-generated heat.
