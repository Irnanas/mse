**You can also reduce your energy usage and carbon emissions:**

1.  Increase your air-conditioner temperature by 1 degree *(and save an additional $15 a year on energy bills!)*
2.  **Reduce your shower time by 2 minutes *(and save 15 litres of water!)*

And while you're at it, save some water by remembering to:

**W**ash clothes on full load   
**A**lways use half-flush when possible   
**T**urn off shower when soaping   
**E**nsure tap is off when brushing teeth   
**R**inse vegetables in a container   

**Getting groceries? Try local.**

Grown in Singapore, for Singapore, locally farmed food is closer to home, which means it is fresher and has a lower carbon footprint. By buying fresh local produce, you are doing your part to support our local farmers as we work towards becoming a more self-sufficient nation.
