## How can you help?

**Start by practising good personal habits. Here's 10 easy ways you can do to reduce waste:**

1.  Swap out plastic bags for reusable bags
2.  Don’t leave the house without a full reusable water bottle.
3.  Instead of ordering coffee to go, order coffee ‘to stay’
4.  Ask for drinks without a straw
5.  Opt for paperless statements for your credit cards, mobile phone or utilities bills
6.  Order only what you can finish when dining out
7.  Store your food properly to make it last longer.
8.  When placing orders for food online, choose the ‘no cutlery’ option
9.  Repair old items or donate them instead of throwing them away
10.  Avoid impulse buys

-   [Recycle right](https://www.towardszerowaste.gov.sg/recycle/)

**You can also reduce your energy usage and carbon emissions:**

1.  Increase your air-conditioner temperature by 1 degree *(and save an additional $15 a year on energy bills!)*
2.  **Reduce your shower time by 2 minutes *(and save 15 litres of water!)*

And while you're at it, save some water by remembering to:

**W**ash clothes on full load   
**A**lways use half-flush when possible   
**T**urn off shower when soaping   
**E**nsure tap is off when brushing teeth   
**R**inse vegetables in a container   

**Getting groceries? Try local.**

Grown in Singapore, for Singapore, locally farmed food is closer to home, which means it is fresher and has a lower carbon footprint. By buying fresh local produce, you are doing your part to support our local farmers as we work towards becoming a more self-sufficient nation.
