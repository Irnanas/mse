Environmentally friendly actions don't have to be large to have an impact. Consistently reducing the amount of energy, water, and paper our businesses use can make a huge difference. How much paper would you save over the course of a year, for instance, if you always printed double-sided copies? A small thing - but the result is big!

Even during your coffee break and lunch-time, little things you do can help save the environment.

Going green on your company’s air-conditioning, lighting, water usage and transport systems could save lots of energy and money too.
