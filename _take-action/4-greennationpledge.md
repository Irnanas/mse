### Take Action Now 

The time to take action is now. Make a pledge and tell us how you will help make Singapore a green, liveable and climate-resilient home! A contributor, an advocate, or a champion, which one are you? Remember, every little effort counts, so do what you can and be a part of the driving force towards a sustainable future.

Please make your [Green Nation Pledge](http://go.gov.sg/greennationpledge) now! You can choose to pledge as an individual or on behalf of your school or organisation. 

We look forward to seeing your commitment to help Singapore become a Green Nation.

<p> Share your pledge on social media with the hashtag <span style="color:#00725c">#GreenNationPledgeSG</span> and you might just inspire someone else to start their green journey today.</p>

### MSE's Green Nation Pledge

MSE pledges to realise a sustainable, resource efficient, and climate resilient Singapore. MSE has developed a [Best Practice Guide for organising environmentally-friendly events](https://www.mse.gov.sg/resources/environmentally-friendly-events-guidelines.pdf). We will adhere to this guide and encourage our stakeholders to do the same. We consider environmental best practices when planning for procurement and operations as well as identifying new green initiatives. We encourage our suppliers to implement similar [environmental practices](http://www.mse.gov.sg/about-us/our-practices). We will continue to develop initiatives and policies under the [Zero Waste Masterplan](https://www.towardszerowaste.gov.sg/zero-waste-masterplan/) to reduce the amount of waste going to our landfill by 30 per cent per capita per day by 2030.
