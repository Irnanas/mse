We are also calling for individuals, educational institutions and organisations to [make pledges](http://go.gov.sg/greennationpledge) to contribute to a green, liveable and climate-resilient Singapore. For each pledge category, there are three tiers: Contributor, Advocate or Champion. Respondents can also choose to pledge as individuals or on behalf of their school / organisation. You are also encouraged to share your pledge by uploading it on your social media accounts with the hashtag #GreenNationPledgeSG.
