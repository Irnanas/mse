**Can projects receive other sources of funding in addition to the SG Eco Fund?**

Applicants are not allowed to receive funding from more than one government grant scheme for the same project. However, applicants can still seek funding from other non-government sources. Applicants will be required to declare their funding sources in the application form.

**When will the results of my grant application be released?**

The release of the outcomes will depend on the grant category and when the application is submitted. The timeline can be found in the table below.

**Can applicants submit more than one application for the SG Eco Fund?**

Yes, an applicant may submit more than one application. Each application should only feature one project. If the applicant is implementing the same programme or curriculum across different communities or locations, then these would be regarded as one project. 

Applicants submitting multiple applications will have to show that they have enough manpower and resources to manage multiple projects. For applicants submitting to both funding categories (Sprout and Main), projects should be distinct from each other.

**Can applicants re-submit a project to the SG Eco Fund that has been rejected previously?**

Applicants are discouraged from submitting the same project to the SG Eco Fund, unless significant changes have been made to better align the proposal with the funding criteria.

**How will the grant be disbursed?**

Grants will be given out on a reimbursement basis, upon completion of project milestones. The project milestones will be set and agreed by both applicant and the Trust before the commencement of the project. 

Upon achieving agreed milestones, the grantee should submit these documents:<br> 
•	Project progress or completion report.<br>
•	Soft copies of original receipts, invoices, and/or payment records. <br>
•	For projects with approved funding quantum of more than S$30,000 – A report of factual findings on their claims, prepared by an external auditor. The cost of engaging the auditor should be included in the project budget during application.

The claim for the final reimbursement should be submitted within three months of the project completion date.

If the grantee requires any upfront funding after the grant has been awarded, please write in to the Trust before the project start date and provide reasons for the request.

**Can the grant be used to support expenses that were incurred before the award of the grant?**

No. Only expenses incurred on or after the project start date (as stated in the offer letter) will be eligible for reimbursement.

**How should receipts be submitted?**

Receipts should be submitted as soft copies together with the progress or completion reports. However, you are required to retain the original hard copies of receipts for a period of 3 years after the completion of your project.

**Do applicants need to audit their invoices and payment records?**

For projects with an approved grant quantum exceeding S$30,000, applicants will have to engage an auditor and submit a report of factual findings for each claim. The cost of engaging the auditor should be included in the project budget during application.

**How do applicants amend their application or provide additional information?**

Once a grant application is submitted, applicants will generally no longer be able to make any amendments. For amendment of critical fields such as project dates and budget amount, applicants may contact the Trust via email to put forth the request. It will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

**Who owns the Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) arising from the project?**

The Grant Recipient and the SG Eco Fund Board of Trustees will co-own all IPRs arising from or created in relation to the Project. The SG Eco Fund retains the rights to utilise IPRs for charitable purposes. 

**Can two or more organisations jointly apply for the SG Eco Fund?**

Yes, multiple organisations can apply together. However, there should be one organisation as the main applicant to submit the application form. The other organisations can be listed as partners. 

The main applicant is responsible for liaising with the Trust Secretariat on the project, signing the Letter of Offer, and submitting the claims for reimbursement. The invoices/payment records for claims should reflect the main applicant’s name, and all reimbursements will only be made to the main applicant.

**How does the SG Eco Fund define ‘community involvement/engagement’?**

Community involvement/engagement is defined as the project enabling or empowering the community to take action for the environment, or involving the community in the design and implementation. Community can be defined broadly as a group of people based on location, interest or sector, e.g. residents living in a town, or members of an interest group. A company’s employees are not considered as part of the community. 

**Does a project need to be ‘new’ to be considered for the SG Eco Fund?**

No, a project does not need to be ‘new’ in order to be eligible for the SG Eco Fund. However, the applicant must explain the need for the project, and make a case for how replicating an existing project will provide additional environmental benefit or how the project will be improved as compared to the existing project. 

**Can an organisation generate profit from a project that receives funding from the SG Eco Fund?**

Yes. The SG Eco Fund recognises the need for financial sustainability of projects. The applicant can generate reasonable (not excessive) profits from the project if it supports the continued operation of the project and advances environmental sustainability in Singapore. 

**If grant recipients do not meet the agreed project targets, can they still receive the reimbursement for their costs?**

When setting project targets in the application, applicants should ensure that the targets are achievable, tangible, quantitative and relevant to the project objectives. The grant recipients would need to provide valid reasons should they not meet the targets. If the reasons are not accepted, reimbursement may be withheld or adjusted.

**If the SG Eco Fund approves a project for funding, does it mean it will support the full 80% of all cost items in an applicant’s budget?**

No. The SG Eco Fund can support up to 80% of supportable cost items, capped at $1 million. The Trust will determine the reasonableness and need of the cost items when evaluating the project.
