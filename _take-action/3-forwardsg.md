####Working Together for a Green, Liveable and Climate-Resilient Singapore

As part of the Forward Singapore exercise, the Government will seek to engage all segments of society to discuss the challenges, constraints as well as opportunities that Singapore faces as we tackle climate change, the trade-offs that Singapore has to balance, our priorities moving forward, and how we can all contribute to realise our vision for the future.

The Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) is inviting members of the public to share their views on how we can foster a more sustainable way of life that stewards our environmental resources responsibly for future generations. Members of public may submit their views at go.gov.sg/stewardenv. The Ministry is also calling for individuals, educational institutions and organisations to make pledges to contribute to a green, liveable and climate-resilient Singapore. Please refer to Annex A for details of upcoming public engagements under the Steward Pillar.
