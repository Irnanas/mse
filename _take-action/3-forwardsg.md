# Forward Singapore's Steward Pillar

Forward Singapore is an opportunity for all of us to come together, examine our values and aspirations, build consensus, and refresh our social compact.

Through this exercise, we will examine what we want to see for Singapore’s future, what we should prioritise, and what each of us is willing to contribute, in order to get there.

## Working Together for a Green, Liveable and Climate-Resilient Singapore

As part of the Forward Singapore exercise, we seek to engage all segments of society to discuss the challenges, constraints as well as opportunities that Singapore faces as we tackle climate change, the trade-offs that Singapore has to balance, our priorities moving forward, and how we can all contribute to realise our vision for the future.

From now to 31 Oct 2022, we would like to invite you to [share your views](http://go.gov.sg/stewardenv) on how we can foster a more sustainable way of life that stewards our environmental resources responsibly for future generations. 

We are also calling for individuals, educational institutions and organisations to [make pledges](https://form.gov.sg/#!/63220530214e7000112adcac) to contribute to a green, liveable and climate-resilient Singapore. For each pledge category, there are three tiers: Contributor, Advocate or Champion. Respondents can also choose to pledge as individuals or on behalf of their school / organisation.
