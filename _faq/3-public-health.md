<h2 id="smoking-prohibition">Smoking Prohibition</h2>
<div>
  	<input type="checkbox" id="title5"  /><label for="title5">Why can&#39;t the Ministry ban smoking in residential units?</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>We recognise that indiscriminate smoking in homes can be distressing and we empathise with those affected. <br>
<br>
The National Environment Agency (NEA) has been progressively extending the smoking prohibition to more public places in consultation with the public and relevant stakeholders. Since 2013, the smoking prohibition has been extended to the common areas of public and private residential premises, including condominiums (e.g. common corridors, stairwells, lobby areas, and void decks). <br>
<br>
Nevertheless, homes are private spaces and our regulations need to be balanced against privacy concerns. Apart from privacy concerns, there are also practical challenges to investigating and enforcing against smoking in homes. It will be challenging to track down the smoker or obtain evidence of an act of smoking being committed without intrusive methods and affecting the privacy of innocent neighbours. <br>
<br>
We adopt a three-pronged approach on this issue:<br>
<br>
a. Engender greater social responsibility by instilling consideration for the health and well-being of those around us, such as our family members and neighbours. This includes the widespread adoption/acceptance of new social norms of what constitutes acceptable behaviour. Agencies will explore effective ways of doing this such as developing targeted messages to be communicated across key platforms.<br>

b. Explore ways to facilitate productive conversations between neighbours to deal with difficult situations, before they escalate into intractable disputes.<br>

c. Study how disputes can be better addressed by the inter-agency Community Dispute Management Framework by reviewing the Community Mediation Process and the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunal (CDRT) to enhance their effectiveness when residents turn to these channels.<br>
<br>
Currently, NEA has collaborated with the Housing &amp; Development Board (HDB), Health Promotion Board (HPB), Municipal Services Office (MSO), and town councils to develop and issue joint advisories to units where feedback on tobacco smoke have been received. The advisory urges smokers to be considerate to their family members and neighbours, as well as advises them on the smoking cessation helplines available. We will continue to encourage and support ground-up efforts by community organisations and the grassroots. <br>
<br>
Living close to one another necessitates good neighbourly behaviour so that we can live together harmoniously. Legislation is not a panacea and we must pursue a community approach. Affected residents are encouraged to resolve their concerns amicably with their neighbours, or seek assistance from a professional mediator from the Community Mediation Centre (CMC). Through joint or private session, trained mediators will facilitate discussions between parties in an effort to reach a mutually acceptable solution. You may call the CMC at 1800 2255 529 or <a href="https://cmc.mlaw.gov.sg/" target="_blank">register a case online</a>.

  	<input type="checkbox" id="title6"  /><label for="title6">Why canâ€™t we ban smoking in all public areas?</label>
	<div class="accordion-content">
		<p>Although the long-term goal is to prohibit smoking at all public places, we need to recognise that smokers also need space to smoke. To reduce the public&#39;s exposure to the harmful effects of second-hand tobacco smoke, the National Environment Agency (NEA) has been progressively extending the smoking prohibition to more public places where the public are more likely to be exposed to second-hand tobacco smoke such as common areas of residential buildings, sheltered walkways, linkways, overhead bridges, outdoor compounds of hospitals, reservoirs and more than 400 parks.<br>
    <br>
    Since 30 June 2017, NEA has also stopped accepting applications for smoking corners in all retail food establishments. Existing smoking corners will remain until the current licences of the retail food establishments are terminated. Retail food establishments with smoking corners are required to demarcate the smoking corner clearly.<br>
    <br>
    As of 2021, 87 out of the 111 hawker centres in Singapore are smoke-free. For the remaining 24 hawker centres with smoking corners, NEA will continue to engage local stakeholders on the progressive removal of smoking corners when opportune. This phased approach is meant to minimise disruption to existing operations and businesses.<br>
    <br>
    Since January 2019, public areas within the Orchard Road precinct have been designated as a No Smoking Zone (NSZ), and smoking is only allowed in Designated Smoking Areas (DSAs). Premises owners are encouraged within the NSZ to demarcate DSAs and put up directional signage within their premises, if they deem it necessary to facilitate the convenience of smokers among their occupants and visitors.<br>
